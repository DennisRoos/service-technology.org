[EXIT STATUS]
Genet exits with 0 on success, and with 1 if an error occurs. See Texinfo manual for detailed information.

[EXAMPLES]

   Example: genet -k 3 shared532_sg.g > shared532_n3.g

   or with drawing

   genet -k 3  shared532_sg.g | draw_astg -nonames | gv -

   For the time being, the input to genet can only be a transition system
   (not another Petri net). To use genet on an already specified Petri net
   (e.g. to get a 3 bounded net for a given 1-bounded)
   preprocess it with write_sg:
       a. write_sg pn1.g > sg1.g
       b. genet -k 3 sg1.g > pn2.g
