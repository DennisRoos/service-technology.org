PURPOSE
    Rachel is a tool to repair deadlocking service choreographies. Many work
    has been conducted to analyze service choreographies to assert manyfold
    correctness criteria. While errors can be detected automatically, the
    correction of defective services is usually done manually. Rachel
    implements a graph-based approach to calculate the minimal edit distance
    between a given defective service and synthesized correct services. This
    edit distance helps to automatically fix found errors while keeping the
    rest of the service untouched.
