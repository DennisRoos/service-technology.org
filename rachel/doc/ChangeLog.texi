@heading Version 1.14-unreleased
@itemize
@item updated maintainer scripts

@item added scripts to use LCOV (@url{http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php}) to determine test case coverage (use @samp{make cover} in @file{tests} directory)

@item added scripts to use ZCOV (@url{http://minormatter.com/zcov}) to determine test branch case coverage (use @samp{make cover-branch} in @file{tests} directory)

@item cleaned code:
@itemize
@item removed support for aspects -- not used any more

@item removed @acronym{BPMN} output -- this does not belong here

@item removed 2-bit annotation -- Wendy can do this
@end itemize

@item implemented Wendy's new IG/OG formats

@item added target for benchmarks (execute @samp{make bench -C tests})

@item implemented parameter @option{--stats} to display information on runtime and memory consumption (the latter uses @code{ps} and does not work under Cygwin)
@end itemize


@heading Version 1.13 (6 June 2009)
@itemize
@item the bit annotations are now written inside the nodes of the Graphviz dot annotation

@item service automata can be drawn as Graphviz dot graphs using mode @option{sa} combined with @option{--dot} (@option{-d})

@item removed @option{--noop} flag

@item reorganized and cleaned up Dot output; in case of calculating an edit distance, only the result is printed; use mode @option{og} or @option{sa} to create a graphic for the input files

@item moved command line parameters for GNU Gengetopt from Makefile to file @file{cmdline.ggo}

@item adapted maintainer scripts for binary distributions to match the filenames used in Fiona

@item Rachel can be translated using the @acronym{LLVM}-frontend for GCC (see @url{http://llvm.org/})

@item updated @file{Doxyfile} and moved in into the @file{doc} directory; the documentation can be created using @samp{make doxygen} which creates the directory @file{doc/doxygen}

@item made adaptions to the Makefile options to be able to create Mac Universal binaries for 64 bit architectures (XCode 3.0 with SDK @samp{MacOSX10.5.sdk} is needed)

@item if Graphviz dot has not been found by the configure script, the dependent tests are skipped instead of throwing an error

@item tests are now organized by @acronym{GNU} Autotest
@end itemize


@heading Version 1.12 (17 January 2009)
@itemize
@item implemented methods to calculate a compact representation of the formulae annotated to the operating guideline's states according to the paper submitted to ACSD 2009; the new method can be triggered with the new mode @option{-m annotation}

@item in mode @option{-m annotation}, the @option{--dot} (@option{-d}) parameter creates a version of the input operating guidelines in which the explicit formulae are replaced by different colors representing the bit representation

@item File input options @option{--og} (@option{-o}) and @option{--automaton} (@option{-a}) are now optional for Gengetopt, but are checked in the @file{main.cc} file. This was necessary, because the @option{-m annotation} mode did not need to parse a service automaton.

@item implemented a mode @option{-m bpmn} to create a rudimentary @acronym{BPMN, Business Process Modeling Notation} output in Graphviz dot format of a service automaton (given by @option{--automaton}); the path of the used stencils can be changed with @option{--shapedir}

@item when using the @option{--dot} (@option{-d}) parameter, a @acronym{PNG, Portable Network Graphics} file is now only created if the parameter @option{--png} is given

@item overworked and beautified Graphviz dot output for operating guidelines: annotated formulae now use mathematical symbols for conjunctions and disjunctions, and the initial state is marked
@end itemize


@heading Version 1.11 (2 November 2008)
@itemize
@item implemented Fiona's modified OG file format (an OG file now also consists of an interface definition) and adjusted the respective test cases --- note that Rachel's parser is backwards compatible and still accepts OG files without interface definition

@item renamed configure script parameter @option{--enable-use64bit} to @option{--enable-64bit} to achieve parameter compatibility with Fiona

@item explicitly handling the disabling of assertions (with parameter @option{--disable-assert}) similar to Fiona's configure script

@item canonized names of constants generated for file @file{src/config.h} and adjusted the output of the @option{--bug} parameter

@item removed unnecessary files @file{src/getopt.c}, @file{src/getopt1.c}, and @file{src/getopt.h}

@item used option @option{gnits} for Automake, see @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/automake.html#Gnits}

@item moved acknowledgements from file @file{AUTHOR} to file @file{THANKS} to meet the strict Gnits requirements

@item updated documentation

@item the configure script now takes care about the compilation flags; for example @command{./configure --enable-64bit} sets the flags necessary to build a 64 bit executable with @command{make}

@item adapted code to avoid warnings of GCC 4.2 (mostly deprecation warnings)

@item overworked test scripts: creation of output files is checked now

@item simplified header inclusion: all typedefs are now made in @file{types.h}

@item added a command line parameter @option{--threshold}/@option{-t} to set a threshold to control the matching algorithm: whenever a formula's assignment reaches this value, it is immediately returned instead of the optimum; this results in faster, yet sub-optimal results 
@end itemize



@heading Version 1.10 (20 August 2008)
@itemize
@item Rachel does not need to be installed to execute @command{make experiments}

@item added configure script parameter @option{--enable-universal} to set flags to build a Mac universal binary (@url{http://www.apple.com/universal})

@item added configure script parameter @option{--enable-win32} to set flags to build a Windows binary which uses the MinGW framework (@url{http://www.mingw.org}) to be independent of the @file{cygwin1.dll} provided by Cygwin (@url{http://www.cygwin.com})

@item added configure script parameter @option{--enable-use64bit} to set flags to build a 64 bit binary (e.g. for x86_64, ppc64, or 64-Bit SPARC)

@item chosen configure script parameters are printed when using @option{--bug} command line parameter

@item made the configure script option @option{--disable-aspects} standard

@item added a command line parameter @option{--noop} to exit after parsing the input files -- mostly for debug information, e.g. if you want to count the services characterized by an OG (combined with @option{--verbose})

@item fixed a bug: the requirements to calculate matching-based edit distance (final states are sink states) led to incorrect formula evaluation (see @url{https://gna.org/bugs/?11944}) when calculating the number of characterized services

@item removed orphaned code for linear programming

@item added more test cases (also expected failures)

@item added code coverage checks using LTP LCOV (@url{http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php}); checks can be invoked in directory @file{tests} with @command{make prepare-cover cover}
@end itemize



@heading Version 1.09 (7 August 2008)

@itemize
@item fixed bug #12153 (@url{https://gna.org/bugs/?12153}): the patch for the aspected sources now works on x86_64 machines

@item fixed a bug in test script @file{tests/test4}: the wrong return value was returned to @command{make check}

@item improved portability of Makefiles by using more built-in variables such as @code{$(MAKE) $(AM_MAKEFLAGS)} or @code{$(SED)}

@item added file @file{doc/cmdline.out} to the distribution to avoid complete compilation just to execute @command{make doc}

@item code complies to ISO C++

@item listing the tools required to re-generated code (Flex, Bison, Gengetopt, and Kimwitu++) in the @file{README} file

@item completed task #6131 (@url{https://gna.org/task/?6131}): whether or not the aspects of AspectC++ are used during compilation can be controlled by parameters of the configure script:

@itemize
@item @command{./configure}: use aspects
@item @command{./configure --enable-aspects}: use aspects
@item @command{./configure --enable-aspects=true}: use aspects
@item @command{./configure --disable-aspects}: do not use aspects
@item @command{./configure --enable-aspects=false}: do not used aspects
@end itemize

If aspects are disabled, the files @file{src/xxxx.cc} are directly copied to @file{src/aspected-xxxx.cc}, and the AspectC++ tools are not at all invoked.

@item MAINTAINER: overworked the Makefile target @option{deb} in the directory @file{maintainer} to create a Debian source package

Note that @command{make deb} can only be executed on a machine where the tools @command{dpkg-buildpackage} and @code{date -R} are present. To upload the source package to a Launchpad PPA (it is currently uploaded to @url{https://launchpad.net/~niels-lohmann/+archive}), the tool @command{dput} is needed. Furthermore, the tools  @command{fakeroot} and @command{alien} are needed to create an RPM binary package from the Debian binary package.
