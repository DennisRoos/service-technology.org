overworked the documentation


@item Version 1.03

some adjustments to improve the compatibility between AspectC++ (@url{http://www.aspectc.org}) and Cygwin


@item Version 1.02

added more files to the deletion list of Makefile target @code{cvs-clean}

acknowledged @url{service-technology.org} where possible (e.g., in the bug address @email{rachel@@service-technology.org})

adjusted the parser to cope with Fiona's new OG file format; Rachel's parser stays backward compatible

the parser now aborts the program in case of an error to avoid subsequent crashes caused by parse errors

the lexer was overworked to be backward compatible with older Flex versions


@item Version 1.01

adding copyright notices to comply to the @acronym{GNU} @acronym{GPL}

added comments

overworked documentation


@item Version 1.00

Tool is now called Rachel = ``@b{R}epairing @b{A}utomata for @b{Ch}oreographies by @b{E}diting @b{L}abels''

adjusted the parameters: changing is now preferred over deletion and insertion

the service counting function @code{Graph::countServices} now uses @code{long double} to count up to @math{10^{4932}}

added a function to calculate the average size of satisfying assignments of the OG's nodes (called with @option{verbose} parameter)

added a preprocessing function to calculate values for node deletion in advance


@item Version 0.20

the check for acyclicity is done right after parsing and not during matching or simulation calculation

added a function to re-enumerate the graphs' nodes to allow the usage of C-style arrays

finally, using C-style multidimensional arrays to cache simulation values in @code{Simulation} and @code{Matching} classes

re-organized @code{Simulation} and @code{Matching} classes: both now inherit from a new class @code{EditDistance} to avoid replication of code


@item Version 0.19

the aspected sources are automatically patched such that @code{size_t} is used instead of @code{unsigned long} in the generated @code{new}-operator

@command{lp_solve} is currently not integrated for unsolved compatibility problems --- an archive @file{lp-solve.tar.gz} is still in the @file{src} folder

documented usage of configuration files and added a sample configuration file

@code{matching} is now the standard for the @option{--mode} parameter

added a preprocessing function to calculate values for node insertion in advance

added a function to count the deterministic acyclic services characterized by the OG (called with @option{verbose} parameter)

the ChangeLog is automatically generated from the Texinfo sources


@item Version 0.18

overworked Makefiles

manpage now shows result for @option{--detailed-help}

added a @option{--debug} mode to trace all function calls of classes Matching and Simulation

added a @option{--verbose} mode to display intermediate progress output

using AspectC++ (@url{http://www.aspectc.org}) to add aspects like the trace calls

added a great optimization in function @code{Matching::permuteEdges} by avoiding subsequent deletion and insertion of the same edge

the ChangeLog is automatically integrated into documentation using a sed script



@item Version 0.17

overworked documentation

caches are cleared after simulation/matching has been calculated

more comments



@item Version 0.16

cleaned and commented code

tidied Makefiles

added a testscript for linear programming translatation

commented linear programming translation

linear programming translation is by @command{lp_solve} library

dramatically improved performance of @code{Matching::perms()} function



@item Version 0.15

added a linear programming calculation for simulation (@option{--mode=lpsim})

the translation to linear programming bases on the algorithm presented in the paper "Simulation-based graph similarity" by Oleg Sokolsky et al. (TACAS 2006)

added @command{lp_solve} (@url{http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5}) to the distributed and linked it as static library (see @file{src/lp_solve/README.txt} for more information)

the @samp{--mode} parameter is now passed as enumeration from getopt



@item Version 0.14

added testscripts for @command{make check}

cache for simulation is again handled by an STL map



@item Version 0.13

Tool is now called ``WS-Fix''

first release at @url{http://www.informatik.uni-rostock.de/~nl/tools}

added cycle detection



@item Version 0.12

Dot and @acronym{PNG,Portable Network Graphics} file is created when @option{--dot} parameter is used

extension and path is cropped from filenames to avoid errors from Dot

reorganized files: helper functions moved to @file{helper.cc/h}

fixed header inclusion to allow compilation on Unix machines

added a Texinfo documentation

using C-style multidimensional arrays to cache simulation values

some statistical output in the main function

the cost functions are declared as inline functions



@item Version 0.11

removed Gnulib again and replaced it by @file{getopt1.c}, @file{getopt.c}, and @file{getopt.h}

usage line is now generated by @acronym{GNU} Gengetopt

a manpage is created using @command{help2man}

values of the algorithm can be configured using the command line or a configuration file



@item Version 0.10

@acronym{GNU} Gengetopt is not needed to configure/make

Automake's missing script is found

included headers for @code{assert} macro

tidied configure script

using Gnulib -- The @acronym{GNU} Portability Library (@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib}) to provide @file{getopt.h}



@item Version 0.9

using @acronym{GNU} Gengetopt (@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt}) to parse command line parameters

added parameter @option{-h} for help

added parameter @option{-V} for version information

added parameter @option{-a} for automaton file

added parameter @option{-o} for OG file

added parameter @option{-m} to select mode (standard: @code{simulation})



@item Version 0.8

the edit actions are annotated to a graph and can be dotted



@item Version 0.7

new nodes are rather added than inserted

nodes are only insered once

nodes are rather deleted than merged

newly added nodes are not considered in function @code{successor()} or @code{outEdges()}

newly added nodes are dotted as dashed nodes



@item Version 0.6

implemented @code{isFinal()} check to test whether final satisfies a formula of the OG

the root node is now read from file instead of being assumed to be @code{1}

nodes are explicitly stored to allow future operations such as adding nodes



@item Version 0.5

matching now returns the action edit actions and outputs them

added Doxygen configuration file

reorgaized headers again (added headers for simulation)



@item Version 0.4

parsed annotations are now used for simulation and matching

reorganized headers (split omnipresent @file{main.h})



@item Version 0.3

annotations are parsed, but not used for calculation

Dot output for graphs implemented



@item Version 0.2

added parser for OG files (taken and adapted from Fiona (@url{http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/top/tools4bpel/fiona}))

currently ignores the annotations, but already works for service automata (simulation checking)



@item Version 0.1

simulation implemented

matching rudimentarily implemented

using @acronym{GNU} autotools
