Version 1.09
============

* fixed bug #12153 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12153'): the patch for the
  aspected sources now works on x86_64 machines

* fixed a bug in test script `tests/test4': the wrong return value was
  returned to `make check'

* improved portability of Makefiles by using more built-in variables such as
  `$(MAKE) $(AM_MAKEFLAGS)' or `$(SED)'

* added file `doc/cmdline.out' to the distribution to avoid complete
  compilation just to execute `make doc'

* code complies to ISO C++

* listing the tools required to re-generated code (Flex, Bison, Gengetopt,
  and Kimwitu++) in the `README' file

* completed task #6131 (`https://gna.org/task/?6131'): whether or not the
  aspects of AspectC++ are used during compilation can be controlled by
  parameters of the configure script:

     * `./configure': use aspects

     * `./configure --enable-aspects': use aspects

     * `./configure --enable-aspects=true': use aspects

     * `./configure --disable-aspects': do not use aspects

     * `./configure --enable-aspects=false': do not used aspects

  If aspects are disabled, the files `src/xxxx.cc' are directly copied to
  `src/aspected-xxxx.cc', and the AspectC++ tools are not at all invoked.

* MAINTAINER: overworked the Makefile target `deb' in the directory
  `maintainer' to create a Debian source package

  Note that `make deb' can only be executed on a machine where the tools
  `dpkg-buildpackage' and `date -R' are present. To upload the source package
  to a Launchpad PPA (it is currently uploaded to
  `https://launchpad.net/~niels-lohmann/+archive'), the tool `dput' is
  needed. Furthermore, the tools  `fakeroot' and `alien' are needed to create
  an RPM binary package from the Debian binary package.
