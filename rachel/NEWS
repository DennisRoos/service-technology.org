Version 1.14-unreleased
=======================

* updated maintainer scripts

* added scripts to use LCOV (`http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php')
  to determine test case coverage (use `make cover' in `tests' directory)

* added scripts to use ZCOV (`http://minormatter.com/zcov') to determine test
  branch case coverage (use `make cover-branch' in `tests' directory)

* cleaned code:
     * removed support for aspects - not used any more

     * removed BPMN output - this does not belong here
