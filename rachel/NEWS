Version 1.12-unreleased
=======================

* implemented methods to calculate a compact representation of the formulae
  annotated to the operating guideline's states according to the paper
  submitted to ACSD 2009

* the new method can be triggered with the new mode `-m annotation'

* File input options `--og' (`-o') and `--automaton' (`-a') are now optional
  for Gengetopt, but are checked in the `main.cc' file. This was necessary,
  because the `-m annotation' mode did not need to parse a service automaton.
