Version 1.12-unreleased
=======================

* implemented methods to calculate a compact representation of the formulae
  annotated to the operating guideline's states according to the paper
  submitted to ACSD 2009; the new method can be triggered with the new mode
  `-m annotation'

* in mode `-m annotation', the `--dot' (`-d') parameter creates a version of
  the input operating guidelines in which the explicit formulae are replaced
  by different colors representing the bit representation

* File input options `--og' (`-o') and `--automaton' (`-a') are now optional
  for Gengetopt, but are checked in the `main.cc' file. This was necessary,
  because the `-m annotation' mode did not need to parse a service automaton.

* implemented a mode `-m bpmn' to create a rudimentary BPMN (Business Process
  Modeling Notation) output in Graphviz dot format of a service automaton
  (given by `--automaton'); the path of the used stencils can be changed with
  `--shapedir'

* when using the `--dot' (`-d') parameter, a PNG (Portable Network Graphics)
  file is now only created if the parameter `--png' is given
