Description: a tool to repair deadlocking service choreographies
  Rachel is a tool to repair deadlocking service choreographies. Much work
  has been conducted to analyze service choreographies to assert manyfold
  correctness criteria. While errors can be detected automatically, the
  correction of defective services is usually done manually. Rachel
  implements a graph-based approach to calculate the minimal edit distance
  between a given defective service and synthesized correct services. This
  edit distance helps to automatically fix found errors while keeping the
  rest of the service untouched.
