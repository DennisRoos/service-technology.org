\brief NetStateEncoder implementation that offers a simple form of compression, based on the observation that small marking values occur much more frequently than large ones.

/// The marking values are converted based on a fixed prefix encoding.
/// Each code word consists of (n-1) 0s, followed by a 1, followed by n arbitrary bits (resulting in a total length of 2n bits).
///
/// Example: For n=1 the two possible code words are 10 and 11, for n=2 the four possible code words are 0100, 0101, 0110 and 0111.
///
/// marking values are assigned to the code words in ascending order, so that small numbers are mapped to short code words.
/// For example, the first few mappings are as follows:
/// - 0 => 10
/// - 1 => 11
/// - 2 => 0100
/// - 3 => 0101
/// - 4 => 0110
/// - 5 => 0111
/// - 6 => 001000
/// - 7 => 001001
/// - and so on.
