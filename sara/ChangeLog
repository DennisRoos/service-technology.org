PURPOSE
Version 1.07 (12 Apr 2011)
==========================

* added option -M to limit the solution length for finding minimal solutions

* last output changes for the model checking contest

Version 1.06 (08 Apr 2011)
==========================

* bug fix: lost constraints led to false negatives

* initial marking read from net if missing in problem statement

* local changes to PNML parser to use name tags for IDs

* allowing for dummy problem statements

Version 1.05 (25 Mar 2011)
==========================

* added output option for simple yes/no

* multiple problems can be logically ORed

Version 1.04 (03 Nov 2010)
==========================

* wrapped Sara into the namespace sara

* added entry point for using Sara as a library

Version 1.03 (16 Sep 2010)
==========================

* added property checks for quasiliveness, proper completion, lazy &
  relaxed soundness to owfn2sara

* extended problem specification so Sara can properly answer questions
  about the above properties

Version 1.02 (07 Sep 2010)
==========================

* added option -show for dot output of solutions and counterexamples

* added utility to detect final marking in owfn net and create a problem
  instance

Version 1.01 (13 Aug 2010)
==========================

* fixed bug in counterexample generation where information from different
  sources (jobs) could not be coordinated and eventually got lost.

Version 1.0 (12 Jul 2010)
=========================

* first release of Sara

Version 0.91-unreleased (6 Jul 2010)
====================================
