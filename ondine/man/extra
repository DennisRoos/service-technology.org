[EXIT STATUS]
Ondine exits with 0 on success, and with 1 if an error occurs. See Texinfo manual for detailed information.

[EXAMPLES]
# <<-- CHANGE START (examples) -->>
To divide a net 'net.owfn' into two components with small interfaces, execute 
.IP
ondine net.owfn comp1.owfn comp2.owfn
.PP
The result will be written the files 'comp1.owfn' and 'comp2.owfn' (or to the shell if the parameter are left out).
# <<-- CHANGE END -->>

[FILES]
Unless a configuration file is explicitly given using the
.B --config
parameter, Ondine first tries to parse file
.B ondine.conf
from the sysconf directory (usually `/usr/local/etc') and then from the current working directory.

[BUGS]
