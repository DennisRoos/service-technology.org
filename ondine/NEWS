Version 1.0 (9 Juli 2011)
=========================

* First version of Ondine

* Splits a given Petri net into two open net components (oWFN).

* Interface is minimized over both components, i.e. as equal as possible
  distribution of the old interface to the two components and at 	the
  same time as few as possible new interface places.

* Incorporates MiniSAT+, a pseudo-Boolean SAT-solver.

\nSee file ChangeLog <http://service-technology.org/files/ondine/ChangeLog> for\ncomplete version history.\n
