Version 1.0-unreleased
======================

* initial release

* classes for peers and (multi and single) peer automata are implemented

* output methods for choreographies and single peer automata are implemented

* sanity check for choreographies implemented

* resolution of dependencies
    1. check for distant messages implemented

    2. resolution of dependencies: if a disables b implemented

    3. resolution of dependencies: if a enables b implemented

    4. resolution of dependencies: q_ab and q_ba are not equivalent (implemented)

* added scripts to use LCOV (`http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php')
  to determine test case coverage (use `make cover' in `tests' directory)
  
* implemented equivalence check for states

* implemented output on stdout

* added THEORY file

* added routines to open and read from files

* added testcase for new error code

* fixed bug #14956 (https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?14956) (added
  regression tests (bug14956a.chor and bug14956b.chor))

* implemented synchronous communication consideration when projecting peers

* fixed bug #14955 (https://gna.org/bugs/index.php?14955) by implementing
  a deadlock checker
  
* added regression test (bug14955.chor)
