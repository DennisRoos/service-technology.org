                      synthesizing partners for services

PURPOSE
    Locretia is a tool to synthesize partners for services. This includes a
    finite characterization of all partners (called "operating guidelines").
    Locretia uses a vast set of reduction rules to synthesize (small) 
    partners. These rules may, however, not preserve all partners of the
    service under consideration, but will synthesize a partner if one exists.
