[EXIT STATUS]
Locretia exits with 0 on success, and with 1 if an error occurs. See Texinfo manual for detailed information.

[EXAMPLES]
To generate a XES log (with default values) from an open workflow net `service.owfn', execute
.IP
locretia --log service.owfn 
.PP
The log will be written to the file `service.xes'.

[FILES]
Unless a configuration file is explicitly given using the
.B --config
parameter, Locretia first tries to parse file
.I locretia.conf
from the sysconf directory (usually `/usr/local/etc') and then from the current working directory.

[REPORTING BUGS]
If you experience a bug, please execute
.IP
locretia --bug
.PP
and send the generated file
.I locretia.conf
together with a description of the problem to
.B locretia@service-technology.org.
