@node First Steps
@chapter First Steps

@section Setup and Installation

@enumerate
@item Go to @url{http://service-technology.org/files/locretia} and download the latest release version of Locretia, say @file{locretia-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz}. To setup and compile Locretia, change into your download directory and type

@cartouche
@smallexample
tar xfz locretia-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
cd locretia-@value{VERSION}
./configure
make
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

After compilation, a binary @samp{src/locretia} is generated.@footnote{On Microsoft Windows, the file will be called @file{locretia.exe}.} If you experience any compiler warnings, don't panic: Locretia contains some generated or third party code that we cannot influence.

@item To test whether everything went fine, type

@cartouche
@smallexample
make check
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

to execute the testcases located in @file{tests}. If everything went fine, you should see something like:@footnote{Some tests use Fiona to check whether the calculated operating guidelines are correct. If Fiona was not found by the configure script, theses tests are skipped.}

@smallexample
## ------------- ##
## Test results. ##
## ------------- ##

All 104 tests were successful.
@end smallexample

If an error occurs, please send the output to @email{locretia@@service-technology.org}.

@item To install the binary, the manpage, and the documentation, type

@cartouche
@smallexample
make install
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

You might need superuser permissions to do so.
@end enumerate

If you need any further information, see file @file{INSTALL} for detailed instructions.


@section Contents of the Distribution

The distribution contains several directories:

@table @file
@item doc
The Texinfo documentation of Locretia. The documentation can be created using @samp{make pdf}. Note you need to have Locretia properly installed before (see installation description above).

@item libs
The Petri Net @acronym{API} used by Locretia to parse and organize the open net.

@item man
The manpage of Locretia which can be displayed using @samp{man locretia} after having Locretia installed (see installation description above).

@item src
The source code of Locretia.

@item tests
Testcases for Locretia which check the generated binary.
@end table

@section Requirements
@anchor{Requirements}

@c !!! DO NOT CHANGE THE NEXT LINE -- IT IS USED AS A FILTER IN SCRIPTS !!!
In order to run, compile, and develop Locretia, several tools are required.

@subsection Runtime
@itemize
@item LoLA (@url{http://service-technology.org/lola}), compiled with the @samp{STATESPACE} option. A suitable LoLA (version 1.14 or above) binary can be created as follows:
@enumerate
@item download @url{http://service-technology.org/files/lola/lola.tar.gz}
@item untar @file{lola.tar.gz}, configure
@item call @samp{make lola-statespace}
@item copy the binary @file{src/lola-statespace} to a directory of your path
(e.g., @file{/usr/local/bin}) or call @samp{make install}
@end enumerate

If LoLA is not installed before Locretia is configured, a source release of LoLA is automatically downloaded and compiled.
@end itemize

Locretia's configure script checks whether LoLA (with binary @file{lola-statespace}) is found in the path and adjusts the configuration file @file{src/locretia.conf} accordingly.


@subsection Compilation
To compile the source code from a source distribution, the following tools are required.

@itemize
@item GCC (@url{http://gcc.gnu.org/}) or Clang (@url{http://clang.llvm.org/})
@item @acronym{GNU} Make (@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/make/})
@end itemize


@subsection Development
In case you want to make changes to the source code, the following tools are required to reconfigure and compile Locretia.

@itemize
@item Autoconf, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/}
@item Automake, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/}
@item Bison, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/}
@item flex, @url{http://flex.sourceforge.net/}
@item Gengetopt, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/}
@item help2man, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/}
@item Texinfo, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/}
@end itemize

@node Command Line Options
@chapter Invoking Locretia

Locretia is a command line tool and does not come with a fancy @acronym{GUI}. However, Locretia can be easily scripted and combined with other tools.

@section Command Line Options

For an overview of the command line options, type @samp{locretia -h} to see the following help screen:

@smallexample
@verbatiminclude cmdline.out
@end smallexample


@section Configuration Files

The parameters can also be controlled using a configuration file that can be read using the @samp{config} option; for example:

@cartouche
@smallexample
locretia net.owfn --config=myconf.conf
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

A configuration file consistes of @code{paramter = value} lines, each line setting the value of a parameter. Note: If not all parameters are defined, the standard values apply.

The configure script creates a default configuration file @file{locretia.conf} which located in the @file{src} folder. When installing Locretia, this is copied to your sysconfig directory (usually @file{/usr/local/etc}).

When Locretia is executed, it evaluates parameters as follows:
@enumerate
@item When a configuration file is given via @option{--config}, it is used.
@item Otherwise, the configuration file @file{locretia.conf} in the local directory is used if present.
@item Otherwise, the configuration file @file{locretia.conf} in the sysconf directory (usually @file{/usr/local/etc}) is used if present.
@item Otherwise, no configuration file is used.
@end enumerate
Parameters given via command-line will overwrite parameters given via configuration files.


@section Compatibility to Fiona

Since Locretia Version 2.6, direct support of Fiona's file format has been discontinued. Instead, a compiler @code{locretia2fiona} can translate Locretia's OG output into Fiona's file format.



@c --------------------------------------------------------------------------


@node Theory
@chapter Theory

@c !!! DO NOT CHANGE THE NEXT LINE -- IT IS USED AS A FILTER IN SCRIPTS !!!
Locretia implements several algorithms and result published in several scientific articles.

@node Exit and Error Codes
@chapter Exit and Error Codes


@section Exit Codes

Locretia will exit with code @samp{0} in case everything went fine. That is, the command-line parameters were valid, the input open net could be read, the reachability graph of the inner could be build, the operating guidelines could be calculated, and---if requested---output files could be successfully written. In case any error occurs, the exit code will be @samp{1} and an error message with an error code (see below) will be printed to the standard error stream.



@section Error Codes

In case any error occurs, Locretia aborts with exit code @samp{1} and prints a message with an error code to the standard error stream.

@table @asis
@item #01
Error opening the input open net or input file not found.

@smallexample
@cartouche
locretia: could not open file `foo.owfn' -- aborting [#01]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #02
Error parsing the input open net. Usually indicates the line of the error and some more or less helpful message on the parse error.

@smallexample
@cartouche
locretia:13: error near `Place': syntax error, unexpected IDENT,
          expecting KEY_INTERFACE or KEY_PLACE -- aborting [#02]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #03
The input open net is not normal. That is, it contains a transition that is connected to more than one interface place. Note that non-normal open net can be normalized using the frontend tool @samp{petri} of the Petri Net @acronym{API}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
locretia: the input open net must be normal -- aborting [#03]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #04
At most one file can be read at once. If no input filename is given, the open net is read from standard input.

@smallexample
@cartouche
locretia: at most one input file must be given -- aborting [#04]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #05
@i{This error code is deprecated since version 1.5.}

@item #06
This error occurs in case Locretia could not parse the reachability graph from LoLA. This might happen if a wrong version of LoLA (e.g., not using the @samp{STATESPACE} mode, see @ref{Requirements}) is used or LoLA runs out of memory. To get the exact parse error, use the command-line option @samp{--verbose}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
locretia: error while parsing the reachability graph -- aborting [#06]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #07
A wrong command-line parameter was given or there was a problem with the combination of command-line parameters. This message is usually accompanied by another message describing the exact problem. Run @samp{locretia --help} for an overview of the valid command-line parameters.

@smallexample
@cartouche
locretia: `--showEmptyNode' option depends on option `dot'
locretia: invalid command-line parameter(s) -- aborting [#07]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #08
The report frequency for built knowledges must be a positive number. To switch off reporting at all, use @samp{--reportFrequency=0}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
locretia: report frequency must not be negative -- aborting [#08]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #09
Interface markings are stored in byte vectors, so the marking of each place has to be stored in one byte. Hence, the message bound must not exceed 255.

@smallexample
@cartouche
locretia: message bound must be between 1 and 255 -- aborting [#09]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #10
@i{This parameter is deprecated since version 2.6.}

@item #11
Error opening a file to write. Usually, this error occurs in case Locretia is called in a directory without writing permissions or the output file is already present, but write protected. Output files can be the target files of the @option{--og} or @option{--dot} parameter as well as the temporary LoLA file @file{tmp.lola} or the generated cover constraint file @file{ogfile.cover}.

@smallexample
@cartouche
locretia: could not write to file `foo.og' -- aborting [#11]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #12
Locretia can either create operating guidelines or a service automaton. The options @option{--og} and @option{--sa} are mutually exclusive.

@smallexample
@cartouche
locretia: `--og' and `--sa' parameter are mutually exclusive -- aborting [#12]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #13
Locretia cannot create a temporary file @file{/tmp/locretia-XXXXXX}, where @samp{XXXXXX} is replaced by a unique name. If this error occurs, check whether the @file{/tmp} folder exists and you have the rights to write there. One reason for this error can be that you are running Locretia under Windows (outside Cygwin), where UNIX-style path names are not recognized. In that case, try using the @option{--tmpfile} parameter. In case you provide a filename without @samp{XXXXXX} suffix, make sure this file does not already exist.

@smallexample
@cartouche
locretia: could not create a temporary file `/tmp/locretia-k4CS4x' -- aborting [#13]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

The parameter @option{--verbose} can give you additional information on the nature of the error, e.g. `Permission denied' or `File exists'.

@item #14
Locretia cannot find the configuration file given by @file{--config} parameter or it has syntax errors. For an example configuration file, see the standard configuration file @file{src/locretia.conf} created by the configure script. See @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html#Configuration-files} for more information on configuration file.

@smallexample
@cartouche
locretia: Error opening configuration file `myconf.conf'
locretia: error reading configuration file `myconf.conf' -- aborting [#14]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #15
Locretia cannot find the cover file given by @option{--cover} parameter or it has syntax errors. 

@smallexample
@cartouche
locretia: could not open cover file `foo.cov' -- aborting [#15]
locretia: error while parsing the cover file -- aborting [#15]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #16
A node that has to be covered (by using the @option{--cover} parameter) does not occur in the given net.

@smallexample
@cartouche
locretia: unknown place `p' in file `foo.cov' -- aborting [#16]
locretia: unknown transition `t' in file `foo.cov' -- aborting [#16]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@item #17
A marking activates two transitions with the same synchronous label. This is not an error of the input net, but a situation Locretia cannot handle due to design decisions. It might be resolved in later versions. See @url{https://gna.org/bugs/?14719} for more information.

@smallexample
@cartouche
locretia: synchronous label `a' of transition `t' already used in this
       marking -- aborting [#17]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@end table

@node ChangeLog
@chapter Version History

@c !!! DO NOT CHANGE THE NEXT LINE -- IT IS USED AS A FILTER IN SCRIPTS !!!
Locretia is developed under the ``Release Early, Release Often'' maxime (see @url{http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html}): Whenever enough integrated or a non-trivial changes have summed up, a new version is published. Though this releases might now always mark significant changes, they at least allow to quickly fix bugs and avoid infinite procrastination.
