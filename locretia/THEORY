Locretia implements several algorithms and result published in several
scientific articles.

XES log
=======

Locretia's main function is to generate logs in the XES format. (See
`http://www.xes-standard.org/'.)

The logs consist of traces which themselves consist of events. The number of
traces in a log can be specified by the user as well as the number of events
in a trace which also can be randomized.

An event contains the label of a fired transition. A trace is a sequence of
transitions which can be fired in the net or the service automaton from the
initial state.  The user may choose if a trace has to end in a final state or
not.

OWFN input
----------

If the input file is an open workflow net then the reachability graph of the
inner is created (thanks to Niels Lohmann for providing the underlying source
code) and is then used to generate the traces of the log.

SA input
--------

In case of a service automaton the traces are built by just making steps in
the automaton.

synchronous and asynchronous environment of an OWFN
===================================================

Locretia can build PNML files containing the synchronous or asynchronous
environment of the given OWFN.

generating an OWFN with random interface from a TPN
===================================================

If a TPN is given as an input file then Locretia can generate an OWFN and add
a random interface to it. The number of interface places can be specified by
the user. At most one interface place per visible transition can be added and
it is randomly chosen between input and output places.
