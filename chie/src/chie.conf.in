# Configuration file for @PACKAGE_STRING@
# @configure_input@

# This file configures the paths to binaries needed by Chie. The configure
# script already tried to suggest paths, but its entries might have been left
# empty. In that case, you need to manually add the path to the respective
# tool.

# TODO: make sure this can be removed
# Chie needs to create a temporary file to pass it to Wendy. The filename
# Chie should use can be specified below. The filename should end with
# 'XXXXXX' which is replaced at runtime with a random string.

tmpfile = /tmp/chie-XXXXXX
