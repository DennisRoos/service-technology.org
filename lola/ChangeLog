Version 1.12
============

* addressed bug #13538 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13538'): `make install'
  installs all binaries with the name `lola' or `lola-xxx' for a standard
  configuration `userconfig.H.xxx' that are present in the `src' folder.
  Likewise, `make uninstall' removes all installed binaries with the name
  `lola' or `lola-xxx' for a standard configuration `userconfig.H.xxx'

* adjusted the parser to cope with different line endings (CR, LF, CRLF)

* licensed LoLA under the GNU Affero General Public License (Affero GPL), see
  file `COPYING'

Version 1.11
============

* fixed bug #12903 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12903'): fixed problems regarding
  `BOUNDEDNET' mode

* fixed bug #12907 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12907'): fixed problems regarding
  `COVER' option

* completed documentation

* adapted code to avoid deprecation warnings of GCC 4.2

* updated `-h' output

* removed old manual `lola-old.ps' from documentation

* adapted documentation to fix bug #12090 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12090'):
  syntax description deviated from implementation

* small changes to the test scripts and the lexer to make LoLA compilable on
  FreeBSD

* added a directory `src/configs' containing some example configurations for
  LoLA; for each file `userconfig.H.xxx' in directory `src/configs' exists a
  Makefile target `lola-xxx' which compiles LoLA with that configuration

* added Makefile target `all-configs' to compile all configurations in
  directory `src/configs'

* added maintainer scripts to create source and binary releases; the latter
  contain binaries of all configurations in directory `src/configs'

* added a directory `utils' for small helper tools: graph2dot creates a
  graphical representation of a reachability graph created by LoLA (using
  option `-G' or `-M')

* command line options are now handled by GNU Gengetopt (see
  `http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt')

* added a manpage for LoLA using `help2man' tool (see
  `http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man')

* added `--enable-mpi' command line parameter for the `configure' script to
  use MPI compiler wrappers instead of GCC (disabled by default)

* added an option `MAXIMALSTATES' to `userconfig.H': by defining this option
  to a value, say 100000, LoLA will abort as soon as more than 100000 states
  are processed; the exit code will be 5

* canonized LoLA's error messages

* removed directory `patches': these options (show number of states after
  capacity excess; limited state space generation) are now built into LoLA

* added `--offspring' command line parameter that creates a file containing
  all necessary information to compile a new binary with the same
  configuration used for the calling binary. To compile this new binary, copy
  the resulting file `userconfig.H.offspring' into the `src/configs'
  directory of the source distribution and run `make lola-offspring'.

Version 1.10
============

* this is an official source release by Karsten Wolf - removed warning after
  executing the configure script

* added a generic Doxygen (`http://www.doxygen.org') configuration file
  `Doxyfile.in'

* completed task #6267 (`http://gna.org/task/?626'): `TWOPHASE' is only set
  when it makes sense, i.e. only in `LIVEPROP' and `HOME'

* actually using command line parameters (`--enable-win32', `--enable-64bit',
  and `--enable-universal') from the configure script

Version 1.03
============

* fixed bug #12302 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12302'): LoLA: Exit Codes in
  `MODELCHECKING': LoLA now returns the result via the `_exit' command

* added directory `patches' collecting some unpublished adjustments

* fixed bug #12063 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12063'): `LIVEPROP' now works
  without crashing

* added a test case `umlprocess' to avoid regression of bug #12063
  (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12063')

* out-commented `TWOPHASE' in `userconfig.H' for liveprop test

* fixed bug #12061 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12061'): `BOUNDEDNET' now works
  without crashing

* added a test case `unbounded' to avoid regression of bug #12061
  (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12061')

* updated the documentation - integrated first parts of
  `http://wwwteo.informatik.uni-rostock.de/ls_tpp/lola/'

* the files `ChangeLog' and `NEWS' are now generated from the file
  `doc/ChangeLog.texi' as it is done in Rachel or BPEL2oWFN

* renamed Makefile target `cvs-clean' to `svn-clean'

* tidied the configure script and removed unnecessary checks

* set bug reporting address to <lola@service-technology.org>

* added command line parameters for the `configure' script:
     * `--disable-assert' to disable assertions (enabled by default)

     * `--enable-64bit' to build for a 64 bit architecture such as x86_64 or
       ppc64 (disabled by default)

     * `--enable-universal' to build a Mac Universal binary which is
       executable on Intel and Power PC platforms (disabled by default)

     * `--enable-win32' to build a Windows binary that is independent of a
       local Cygwin installation (disabled by default)

* updated documentation - took text from
  `http://wwwteo.informatik.uni-rostock.de/ls_tpp/lola'

Version 1.02
============

* fixed bug #12089 `https://gna.org/bugs/?12089'

* added Makefile target `win-bin' that produces a Cygwin independent binary
  when compiling under Cygwin, helps to avoid bug #12071
  `http://gna.org/bugs/?12071'

* added a testcase `choreography' from a BPEL4Chor choreography using
  symmetries (see file `tests/nets/choreography.tar.gz' on how to create this
  file with BPEL2oWFN)

* fixed bug #12097 `https://gna.org/bugs/?12097'

* fixed bug #12109 `https://gna.org/bugs/?12109'

Version 1.01
============

* fixed bug #12062 `http://gna.org/bugs/?12062'

* added Makefile target `cvs-clean' that removes all files that can be
  rebuilt by `autoreconf -iv'

* the information gathered by the configure script is now collected in a
  header file `src/config.H'

* tidied Makefiles

* added a testsuite (invoked by Makefile target `check') consisting of:
     * the Dining Philosophers

     * the Echo Algorithm (currently not used)

     * a business process translated from a UML specification

     * an AI planning problem

* added the documentation from
  `http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/~kschmidt/doku.ps'

* added a (undocumented) command line parameter `--bug' for debug purposes

Version 1.00
============

* code of a version of Karsten Wolf that has not been officially released;
  this version is not a completely tested version and is only intended for
  internal purposes

* minor adjustments (only affecting the frontend) to use the GNU Autotools
