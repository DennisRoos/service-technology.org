PURPOSE
    LoLA (a Low Level Petri Net Analyzer) has been implemented for the
    validation of reduction techniques for place/transition net state spaces.
    Its particular strengths include
    
     * A large number of available state space reduction techniques many of
       which may be applied jointly;
     * A high degree of automation for various state space reduction
       techniques
     * Availability of dedicated variations of state space reduction
       techniques for several frequently used properties
     * efficient implementation exploiting the particular nature of Petri net
       models simple textual interaction for easy integration into other
       tools

    LoLA has been tested on several UNIX platforms (Solaris, SUN-OS, LINUX)
    as well as under WINDOWS using the CYGWIN environment.
