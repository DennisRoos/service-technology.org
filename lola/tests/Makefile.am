# This Makefile organizes the generation of the test suite, the code coverage
# and the packaging of the tests. It consists of three parts, of which you
# need to change the first if you want to add test files and the second if
# you want to exclude files from the test case coverage (very seldomly). The
# last part is generic and you must not change it.


#--------------------#
# Part 1: Test Files #
#--------------------#

# If you want to use a new test file in a test case, proceed as follows:
# 1. Edit the file `testsuite.at' and add your test case
# 2. Add the files you need for the test to the `testfile' directory.
# 3. Add these files (without path) to the `TESTFILES' list.
# 4. Add the file to the SVN repository.
TESTFILES = bug15282.lola \
            choreography.lola \
            choreography.tar.gz \
            data.lola \
            echo.lola \
            echo.task \
            garavel.lola \
            phils.lola \
            planner.lola \
            planner.task \
            process.lola \
            process.task \
            umlprocess.lola \
            unbounded.lola


#-----------------------------------------#
# Part 2: Exclusions for the Cover Script #
#-----------------------------------------#

# Below you can list all the files you do not want to have counted in the
# coverability report that can be created by calling "make cover". Usually,
# these files are generated code or helper libraries that have not much to
# do with your tool.
# Absolute filenames are expected, but you may use '*' as wildcard. For
# example '*/libs/*' ignores everything in the 'libs' directory and
# '*/cmdline.c' will exclude any file in the sources called 'cmdline.c'.
NO_COVER_FILES = */readnet-lexic.cc */readnet-syntax.cc */cmdline.*

# Part 3: Generics -- YOU MUST NOT CHANGE ANYTHING BELOW #
