Version 1.11-unreleased
=======================

* completed documentation

* adapted code to avoid deprecation warnings of GCC 4.2

* updated `-h' output

* removed old manual `lola-old.ps' from documentation

* adapted documentation to fix bug #12090 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12090'):
  syntax description deviated from implementation

* small changes to the test scripts and the lexer to make LoLA compilable on
  FreeBSD

* added a directory `src/configs' containing some example configurations for
  LoLA; for each file `userconfig.H.xxx' in directory `src/configs' exists a
  Makefile target `lola-xxx' which compiles LoLA with that configuration

* added Makefile target `all-configs' to compile all configurations in
  directory `src/configs'

* added maintainer scripts to create source and binary releases; the latter
  contain binaries of all configurations in directory `src/configs'

* added a directory `utils' for small helper tools: graph2dot creates a
  graphical representation of a reachability graph created by LoLA (using
  option `-G' or `-M')

* command line options are now handled by GNU Gengetopt (see
  `http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt')

* added a manpage for LoLA using `help2man' tool (see
  `http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man')

* added `--enable-mpi' command line parameter for the `configure' script to
  use MPI compiler wrappers instead of GCC (disabled by default)

* added an option `MAXIMALSTATES' to `userconfig.H': by defining this option
  to a value, say 100000, LoLA will abort as soon as more than 100000 states
  are processed; the exit code will be 5

* canonized LoLA's error messages

* removed directory `patches': these options (show number of states after
  capacity excess; limited state space generation) are now built into LoLA

* added `--offspring' command line parameter that creates a file containing
  all necessary information to compile a new binary with the same
  configuration used for the calling binary. To compile this new binary, copy
  the resulting file `userconfig.H.offspring' into the `src/configs'
  directory of the source distribution and run `make lola-offspring'.
