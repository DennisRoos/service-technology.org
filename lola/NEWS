Version 1.15
============

* fixed bug #15223 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?15223'): the coverability graph is
  now not used in the `HOME' mode

* fixed compilation problems under Linux

* added a parameter `-r'/`--resultFile' to write all analysis results into a
  single file in the file format of libconfig (see
  `http://www.hyperrealm.com/libconfig')

* fixed bug #12910 and bug #15282 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12910' and
  `https://gna.org/bugs/?15282'): file output for `-g' and `-m' parameter was
  broken

* added user configurations for the binaries used by the ProM plugin

* fixed bug #15678 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?15678'): `HOME' now switches on
  `TWOPHASE' if `STUBBORN' is also used

* started implementing stubborn sets for `STATESPACE' option; this option now
  assumes an extended CTL formula of the form E[\tau]F \phi to be given. All
  mentioned transitions in \tau are set to visible, and the formula \phi is
  treated like a state predicate.

* fixed bug #18024 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?18024'): parameters can now be
  used without trailing space, for instance `-a analysisfile.task' is now
  equivalent to `-aanalysisfile.task'

* configure LoLA with `--enable-syslog' to additionally write verbose output
  to the syslog (e.g. `/var/log/system.log')

* polished messages

* added tool `form' (in folder `utils') to translate formulae of the SUMo
  2011 Model Checking Contest into LoLA file format

* version submitted to the SUMo 2011 Model Checking Contest
  (`http://sumo.lip6.fr/Model_Checking_Contest.html')
