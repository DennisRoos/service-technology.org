Version 1.18
============

* You can now define LIMITCAPACITY if you want LoLA to stop at a marking 
  if state space construction reaches a state with more tokens on a place 
  than specified. The state is then marked with 'BAD: 1' in the output. This 
  has only been tested with the same settings as lola-statespace. Other 
  options may be harmed by setting LIMITCAPACITY so be aware. NOTE: The 
  capacity can be set via the command-line (--capacity=...)

* Added a configuration which uses the above functionality. The created 
  binary is called 'lola-boundedgraph'.
