Version 1.10
============

* this is an official source release by Karsten Wolf - removed warning after
  executing the configure script

* added a generic Doxygen (`http://www.doxygen.org') configuration file
  `Doxyfile.in'

* completed task #6267 (`http://gna.org/task/?626'): `TWOPHASE' is only set
  when it makes sense, i.e. only in `LIVEPROP' and `HOME'

* actually using command line parameters (`--enable-win32', `--enable-64bit',
  and `--enable-universal') from the configure script
