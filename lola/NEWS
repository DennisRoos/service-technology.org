Version 1.12
============

* addressed bug #13538 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?13538'): `make install'
  installs all binaries with the name `lola' or `lola-xxx' for a standard
  configuration `userconfig.H.xxx' that are present in the `src' folder.
  Likewise, `make uninstall' removes all installed binaries with the name
  `lola' or `lola-xxx' for a standard configuration `userconfig.H.xxx'

* adjusted the parser to cope with different line endings (CR, LF, CRLF)

* licensed LoLA under the GNU Affero General Public License (Affero GPL), see
  file `COPYING'
