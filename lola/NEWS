Version 1.11-unreleased
=======================

* completed documentation

* adapted code to avoid deprecation warnings of GCC 4.2

* updated `-h' output

* removed old manual `lola-old.ps' from documentation

* adapted documentation to fix bug #12090 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12090'):
  syntax description deviated from implementation

* small changes to the test scripts and the lexer to make LoLA compilable on
  FreeBSD

* added a directory `src/configs' containing some example configurations for
  LoLA; for each file `userconfig.H.xxx' in directory `src/configs' exists a
  Makefile target `lola-xxx' which compiles LoLA with that configuration

* added Makefile target `all-configs' to compile all configurations in
  directory `src/configs'

* added maintainer scripts to create source and binary releases; the latter
  contain binaries of all configurations in directory `src/configs'
