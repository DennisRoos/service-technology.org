This package defines an Eclipse plugin that provides additional 
language support for the Service-Technology.org Editor Application Seda.
The language is a variant of the Flowchart notation that has been
extended with domain-specific concepts to support modeling processes
in disaster management.

This package provides functionality to import a Visio Diagram in Flow-Chart
notation into an object-oriented representation of flowchart diagrams.
