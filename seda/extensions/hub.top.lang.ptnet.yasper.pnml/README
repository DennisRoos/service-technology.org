This package defines an Eclipse plugin that provides additional 
language support for the Service-Technology.org Editor Application Seda.

This package provides file reading and writing support for PNML with
extensions supported by the tool Yasper, see http://www.yasper.org/

To use this package, the Java source code for the Yasper PNML support must
be generated. To do this, "Generate Model Code" (and optionally
"Generate Edit Code", and "Generate Editor Code") from the 
./model/Yasper_EPNML_1_1_4.genmodel file. This will produce Java code and
Eclipse plugin files for

hub.top.lang.ptnet.yasper.pnml
hub.top.lang.ptnet.yasper.pnml.edit   (optional)
hub.top.lang.ptnet.yasper.pnml.editor (optional)
