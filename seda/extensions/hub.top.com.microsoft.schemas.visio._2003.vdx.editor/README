This package defines an Eclipse plugin that provides additional 
language support for the Service-Technology.org Editor Application Seda.
The language is a variant of the Flowchart notation that has been
extended with domain-specific concepts to support modeling processes
in disaster management.

This package provides an Visio XML file importer for Visio diagrams that
use flow chart shapes. The importer generates model files and diagrams
that comply to hub.top.lang.flowcharts
