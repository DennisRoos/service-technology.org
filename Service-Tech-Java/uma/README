PURPOSE
    UMA (an Unfolding-based Model Analyzer) has been implemented for the
    validation of state-space construction techniques for place/transition
    net state spaces and scenario-based specifications. Its particular
    strengths include
    
     * a compact representation of a system's state-space based on McMillan's
       technique of finite complete prefixes of Petri net unfoldings;
     * applicable to scenario-based models with history-based enabling conditions; 
     * techniques to transform and change model structures based on their
       unfoldings.

    UMA is platform independent and runs on all platforms with a Java runtime
    environment.
