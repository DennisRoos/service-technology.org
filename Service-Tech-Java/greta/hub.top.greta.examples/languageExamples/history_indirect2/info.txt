Description: In this example, action y can only occur after action r 
occurred. However, r does not have to be a direct predecessor of y. 
Rather, there can be an arbitrary number of other events between y 
and r. Once y occurred, another occurrence of r (and preceding x) is 
needed to enable y again. Additionally, r cannot immediately succeed 
x as there need to be two occurrences of condition q (i.e. s has to 
occur). Likewise after r there need to be two occurrences of q 
before y can occur. However the precondition q of r requires that 
there is no event r between q and the other predecessor q. Hence 
after r occurred, only s will be enabled.
