Description: In this example, action r can only occur after y
occurred. However, y does not have to be a direct predecessor of r. 
Rather, there can be an arbitrary number of other events between y 
and r. Once r occurred, another occurrence of y is needed to enable r 
again.
In contrast and because of oclet o3, y can occur at any time as soon 
as there is some occurrence of y in the run.
