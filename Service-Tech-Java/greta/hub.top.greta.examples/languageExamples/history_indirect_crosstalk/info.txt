Example: history_indirect_crosstalk
Author: dfahland

Description: In this crosstalk specification, left and right
communicate in rounds: request -> reply -> ack. If both, left and 
right, request at the same time, crosstalk occurs and they have to 
retry. Oclet prevent_crosstalk_left will disallow left from sending a
request if crosstalk just occurred and crosstalk occurred some time 
ago.
