ServiceTechnolog.org - Graphical Runtime Environment for Adaptive Processes
Animated Execution Plugin (hub.top.GRETA.run)
===========================================================================

PURPOSE
    The Animated Execution Plugin for GRETA provides an execution engine
    for the GRETA (http://service-technology.org/greta). The plugin has
    been implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of scenario-based
    modeling of distributed systems in the context of Petri nets. In
    addition, it demonstrates a flexible approach to modeling distributed
    systems by integrating graphical modeler and execution engine. 

    GRETA is platform independent and runs on all platforms with a Java runtime
    environment; see hub.top.GRETA/README.
