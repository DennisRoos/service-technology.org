2 Source code implementations of the model
------------------------------------------

2.1 PtNet
---------

Upon creation, a PtNet always gets an initial marking and a final marking.
The final marking is optional wrt. the model. The automatic creation of the
final marking has to be made dependent on whether the net has places which
are considered as such.
This functionality is implemented in the PtnetLoLAFactory.
