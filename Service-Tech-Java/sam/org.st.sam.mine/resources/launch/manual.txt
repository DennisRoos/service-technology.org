This release provides automated experiment execution functionality.

To run an experiment, call:

  sam_mine <inputfile.xes.gz> <support> <confidence>
  
All log files for experiments are stored in the directory './experiments/'.
For instance, call:

  sam_mine experiments\crossftp_succinct\crossftp_succinct_traceset.xes.gz 10 1.0

The scenarios will be mined from the given log file. The results will
be stored in a directory 'results_XXX' next to the given log file. The
results directory contains the file 

  results.html
  
which provides an overview on the mining results: input tree,
statistics, discovered scenarios and coverage of the tree by the
scenarios. The file

  lscs.txt
  
contains all discovered LSCs that are shown graphically in
'results.html' in textual form.

The directory name 'results_XXX' mentions the call parameters and the
time, so running the experiment again will not overwrite the old results.

There are some "Experiment Suites" available.

  * To run a standard experiment with relatively high support and
    confidence values, execute 'run_all_simple.bat'.
  * For an experiment with varying support and confidence settings
    on the same data set, execute 'run_crossftp_succinct_mult.bat'.
    
REQUIREMENTS:
  1. The tool needs 'mscgen' (which is packed with this tool in
     './resources/mscgen') to render the discovered LSCs.
  2. The tool needs GraphViz Dot to render the trees.
  
The path to the binaries of these tools are stored in './sam_mine.properties'
The default settings assume 'mscgen' to be stored in  ./resources/mscgen' and
GraphViz Dot to be available on the path (i.e. can be called from anywhere).
Adjust the settings in './sam_mine.properties' to your system to run the tool.
