[EXIT STATUS]
Petia exits with 0 on success, and with 1 if an error occurs. See Texinfo manual for detailed information.

[EXAMPLES]
# <<-- CHANGE START (examples) -->>
To compute the equivalence class of place of a net 'net.owfn', execute 
.IP
petia net.owfn --owfn
.PP
The result will be written to the shell.
# <<-- CHANGE END -->>

[FILES]
Unless a configuration file is explicitly given using the
.B --config
parameter, Petia first tries to parse file
.B petia.conf
from the sysconf directory (usually `/usr/local/etc') and then from the current working directory.
