                Petia --- Place Equivalence Through (semipositive) Invariant Analysis
		http://service-technology.org/petia



Version 1.0 (20 Juli 2011)
=============================

* First version of Petia

* Detects for any given pair of places if there is a semipositive place 
	invariant in which one of the places occurs and the other does not.
	Such places are non-equivalent.

* Builds the equivalence relation over all places of a net and prints
	the equivalence classes.

* Incorporates lp_solve, a linear programming solver.
