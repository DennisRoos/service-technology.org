# This file configures the paths to binaries needed by Petia. The configure
# script already tried to suggest paths, but its entries might have been left
# empty. In that case, you need to manually add the path to the respective
# tool.

# Petia might (in the future) need to create a temporary file to pass it on.
# The filename Petia should use can be specified below. The filename should
# end with 'XXXXXX' which is replaced at runtime with a random string.
