[EXIT STATUS]
Locretia exits with 0 on success, and with 1 if an error occurs. See Texinfo manual for detailed information.

[EXAMPLES]
To generate a BSD automaton with bound 1 from an open workflow net `service.owfn', execute
.IP
BSD service.owfn --bound=1
.PP
The BSD automaton will be written to the file `service_b1.dot'.

[FILES]
Unless a configuration file is explicitly given using the
.B --config
parameter, BSD first tries to parse file
.I BSD.conf
from the sysconf directory (usually `/usr/local/etc') and then from the current working directory.

[REPORTING BUGS]
If you experience a bug, please execute
.IP
BSD --bug
.PP
and send the generated file
.I BSD.conf
together with a description of the problem to
.B BSD@service-technology.org.
At https://gna.org/bugs/?group=service-tech you can see a list of open bugs.
