# Configuration file for Anastasia 1.0-unreleased
# src/anastasia.conf.  Generated from anastasia.conf.in by configure.

# This file configures the paths to binaries needed by Anastasia. The configure
# script already tried to suggest paths, but its entries might have been left
# empty. In that case, you need to manually add the path to the respective
# tool.

# <<-- CHANGE START (needed binaries, etc. in config-file) -->>

# Hello might (in the future) need to create a temporary file to pass it on.
# The filename Anastasia should use can be specified below. The filename should
# end with 'XXXXXX' which is replaced at runtime with a random string.

tmpfile = /tmp/anastasia-XXXXXX
