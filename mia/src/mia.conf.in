# Configuration file for @PACKAGE_STRING@
# @configure_input@

# This file configures the paths to binaries needed by Mia. The configure
# script already tried to suggest paths, but its entries might have been left
# empty. In that case, you need to manually add the path to the respective
# tool.

# Mia needs a LoLA binary that builds complete unreduced state spaces. Such
# a LoLA binary can be built by executing "make lola-statespace" using a recent
# LoLA distribution, available at http://service-technology.org/files/lola.

lola-statespace = @LOLA_STATESPACE@

# Mia can exploit the fact that the state space of a composition is safe by
# design. Such a LoLA binary can be built by executing "make lola-statespace1" using
# a recent LoLA distribution, available at
# http://service-technology.org/files/lola. You can also set 'lola-statespace1' to
# the same value as 'lola-statespace'.

lola-statespace1 = @LOLA_STATESPACE1@

# Mia needs a Wendy binary (version 1.4 and above). Recent distribtions can
# are available at http://service-technology.org/files/wendy.

wendy = @WENDY@

# Mia needs to create a temporary file to pass it to Wendy and LoLA. 
# The filename Mia should use can be specified below. The filename should end 
# with 'XXXXXX' which is replaced at runtime with a random string. In case 
# you use MinGW, path names are ignored and the basename is used instead.

tmpfile = /tmp/mia-XXXXXX
