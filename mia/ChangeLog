Version 1.1-unreleased
======================

* moved verbose output functions to `verbose.*'

* added GNU Affero GPL headers

* added parameters `--lola-full', `--lola-full1', and `--wendy' to manually
  provide the paths of the required binaries

* Mia can be configured with a configuration file, provided by parameter
  `--config' (see
  `http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html#Configuration-files'
  for more information). A standard configuration is created by the configure
  script and written to `src/mia.conf'. When Mia is executed, it checks for
  the file `mia.conf' in the sysconfig folder (usually `/usr/local/etc') and
  in the current directory. If neither file was found, Mia tries to rely on
  standard filenames.

* added generic Makefile target (`bin' in `maintainer') to create a binary
  release for the running platform (using `uname')

Version 1.0
===========

* initial release

* Mia can calculate the jumper transitions to migrate instances

* depends on Wendy 1.4+ and LoLA (compiled with `FULL' option)
