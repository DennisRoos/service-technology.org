Version 1.2
===========

* canonized Makefiles

* added scripts to use LCOV
  (`http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php') to determine test case
  coverage (use `make cover' in `tests' directory)

* added target for benchmarks (execute `make bench -C tests')

* implemented parameter `--stats' to display information on runtime and
  memory consumption (the latter uses `ps' and does not work under Cygwin)

* colored status messages

* updated the Petri Net API 4.02 (revision r5970)

Version 1.1
===========

* moved verbose output functions to `verbose.*'

* added GNU Affero GPL headers

* added parameters `--lola-full', `--lola-full1', and `--wendy' to manually
  provide the paths of the required binaries

* Mia can be configured with a configuration file, provided by parameter
  `--config' (see
  `http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/gengetopt.html#Configuration-files'
  for more information). A standard configuration is created by the
  configure script and written to `src/mia.conf'. When Mia is executed, it
  checks for the file `mia.conf' in the sysconfig folder (usually
  `/usr/local/etc') and in the current directory. If neither file was
  found, Mia tries to rely on standard options.

* added generic Makefile target (`bin' in `maintainer') to create a binary
  release for the running platform (using `uname')

* added improved Petri Net API files (faster parsing and composition)

* added output of runtimes of invoked tools and complex operations

* added `--bug' option to create debug output

Version 1.0
===========

* initial release

* Mia can calculate the jumper transitions to migrate instances

* depends on Wendy 1.4+ and LoLA (compiled with `FULL' option)
