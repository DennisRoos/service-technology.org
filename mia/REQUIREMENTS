In order to run, compile, and develop Mia, several tools are required.

Runtime
=======

   * Wendy (`http://service-technology.org/wendy'), at least version 1.4

   * LoLA (`http://service-technology.org/lola'), compiled with the `FULL' option

Mia's configure script checks whether these tools (with binaries `wendy' and
`lola-full') are found in the path and adjusts the configuration file
`src/mia.conf' accordingly.

Compilation
===========

To compile the source code from a source distribution, the following tools are
required.

   * GCC (`http://gcc.gnu.org/')

   * GNU Make (`http://www.gnu.org/software/make/')

Development
===========

In case you want to make changes to the source code, the following tools are
required to reconfigure and compile Mia.

   * Autoconf, `http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/'

   * Automake, `http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/'

   * Bison, `http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/'

   * flex, `http://flex.sourceforge.net/'

   * Gengetopt, `http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/'

   * help2man, `http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/'

   * Texinfo, `http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/'

Please check our nightly build server at `http://service-technology.org/nightly'
for the versions we use during development.
