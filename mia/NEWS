Version 1.2-unreleased
======================

* update Petri Net API

* canonized Makefiles

* added scripts to use LCOV
  (`http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php') to determine test case
  coverage (use `make cover' in `tests' directory)

* added target for benchmarks (execute `make bench -C tests')

* implemented parameter `--stats' to display information on runtime and
  memory consumption (the latter uses `ps' and does not work under Cygwin)
