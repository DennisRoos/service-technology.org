The ProM plugins by service-technology.org

This file explains how to setup the source files of this package to
run and develop ProM plugins in Eclipse. 

1. First, check out the current version of this package from
   
   svn://svn.gna.org/svn/service-tech/trunk/prom

   via "File > Import > SVN > Checkout Projects from SVN". The
   wizard will prompt you for a name of the project to where the
   package will be checked out. The standard directory is "prom".
   Choose OK to let Eclipse/SVN create the new project called "prom",
   check out all source files from the repository and all ProM
   framework files from the ProM repository. The latter files provide
   the runtime environment to run our plugins and to develop new
   plugins for ProM.
   
2. To run ProM with our service-technology.org plugins,
   right-click on "ProM with UITopia (ServiceTech).launch" and
   choose "Run as > ProM with UITopia (ServiceTech)". This will
   initialize and load the ProM framework. You may now use ProM and
   the service-technology.org plugins.
   
3. To develop and debug your own plugins, right-click on
   "ProM with UITopia (ServiceTech).launch" and
   choose "Debug as > ProM with UITopia (ServiceTech)". This will
   launch the ProM framework with Eclipse's debugging functionality.
   You may set breakpoints in your source code and watch for exceptions
   as needed for debugging your code.
   
4. If you need additional plugins from the ProM framework, you can
   install them by running the "Prom Package Manager (ServiceTech)".
   
If you decide to check out the package into a different Eclipse project
than "prom", you have to update the .launch configuration files. Search
and replace every occurrence of "prom" (lower case only!) by the name
of your Eclipse project.
