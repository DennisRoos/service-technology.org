# This file configures the paths to binaries needed by Hello. The configure
# script already tried to suggest paths, but its entries might have been left
# empty. In that case, you need to manually add the path to the respective
# tool.

# Hello needs a Wendy binary. Such a Wendy binary can be built by executing
# "make wendy" using a recent Wendy distribution, available at
