\section{Overview}\label{sec:Overview}
\subsection{Introduction}\label{subsec:Introduction}

\textit{Fiona} is a tool to automatically analyze the interactional behavior of open workflow nets
(\textit{oWFN}) [MRS05]. It provides the following techniques:

\begin{itemize}
\item It checks for the controllability of the given net by
computing the interaction graph [Wei04].
\item It calculates the operating guideline [MRS05] for the
net.
\item It matches an open workflow net (\textit{oWFN}) with an already existing
operating guideline [MRS05].
\item It can do various calculations on operating guidelines, including checks for equality and
equivalence, computing the product of two operating guidelines, computing the number of
characterized services, simulating and filtering.
\end{itemize}

Fiona uses operating guidelines and oWFNs as its input. oWFNs are the output of the tool
\textit{BPEL2oWFN}. Thus, any \textit{BPEL} (\textit{Business Process Execution Language for Web
Services}) process can easily be analyzed.

To compute the states of the graph nodes \textit{Fiona} uses the efficient algorithms that were
implemented in the model checking tool \textit{LoLA}.

\textit{Fiona} was developed by \selectlanguage{ngerman}Daniela Weinberg, Peter Massuthe, Karsten Wolf,
Kathrin Kaschner, Christian Gierds, Jan Bretschneider and Martin Znamirowski. \selectlanguage{english} It is part of the
Tools4\textit{BPEL} project funded by the German Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung. 

See \url{http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/top/tools4bpel} for details.

\newpage
\section{Installation}\label{sec:Installation}
There are two possibilities to get \textit{Fiona} running. Either using the precompiled binaries
for a variety of operating systems or compiling the source code yourself. Both, the binaries and
the source code can be found in the download section of the website:
\begin{quote} 
\url{http://www2.informatik.hu-berlin.de/top/tools4bpel/fiona/download.html}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Using the binaries}\label{subsec:UsingTheBinaries}

Even when using the binaries, \textit{Fiona} will not have its complete functionality unless
\textit{GraphViz dot} is installed. In order to create graphical output \textit{Fiona} uses system calls to
\textit{dot}, so either \textit{dot} has to be callable in the same form which fiona is called or no graphical output will be created. 
Not having \textit{dot} installed should not interfere with execution in any other way than
lacking graphical output.

\subsection{Using the source code}\label{subsec:UsingTheSourceCode}

Unpack the the \texttt{fiona-2.0.tar.gz} into one directory keeping the archived folder structure. Before
fiona can be compiled a number of tools has to be available at the shell. For a detailed list of
those tools refer to the installation guide given in the \texttt{/doc}-directory. Supposing that all
necessary tools are available you can compile fiona by entering the source directory and typing the
following commands:
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim} 
automake -i
./configure
make
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
To check if the compilation was succesful you can also type \texttt{make check}. The check should
pass all tests except for those mentioned in section \ref{sec:LimitationsAndBugs} on page \pageref{sec:LimitationsAndBugs}.

\newpage
\section{Invoking \textit{Fiona}}\label{sec:InvokingFiona}

\textit{Fiona}'s primary uses are deciding controllability of and building operating
guidelines for services given as \textit{oWFN}s. Therefore the standard invocations of
\textit{Fiona} are:

\begin{itemize}
\item checking controllability: \texttt{fiona -t ig inputNet.owfn}
\item calculating the operating guideline: \texttt{fiona -t og inputNet.owfn}
\end{itemize}

where \texttt{inputNet.owfn} contains an \textit{oWFN} written in the appropriate format
\ref{sec:InputFormats} on page \pageref{sec:InputFormats}. The option \texttt{-t ig} lets \textit{Fiona} generate the interaction
graph of the given net. In case the graph's size is not too big, a \texttt{png} graphic file is created that
shows the interaction graph. Furthermore an output is written on the command line indicating the size
of the graph and the statement whether the oWFN is controllable or not.

The option \texttt{-t og} lets \textit{Fiona} generate the operating guideline of the given
\textit{oWFN}. In case the graph's size is not too big, a \texttt{png} graphic file is created that shows the
operating guideline. Furthermore an output is written on the command line indicating various statistics
of the operating guideline.

Since the start of the \textit{fiona} development process a lot of additional operations that primarily deal with operating
guidelines have been included. A short description of those functions is given in this section, for
more details on operating guidelines see section \ref{sec:OG} on page \pageref{sec:OG}.

For more examples, see subsection \ref{subsec:Examples} on page \pageref{subsec:Examples}.

\textit{Fiona} can be called without any parameter. In this case, it calculates the interaction
graph of the \textit{oWFN}, that is being read from the standard input (\texttt{stdin}).

The invocationscheme is as follows:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{fiona [OPTION]* [FILES]*}
\end{quote}

Note: Every file read will be automatically recognized as an oWFN or operating guideline by its
content or throw an error. Fiona supports reading multiple files by the '*' operator, for example:
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
fiona -t og *.owfn
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

Checks if the oWFN toBeMatched.owfn matches with the toMatch.og operating guideline with all debug
information being shown in the process. 

\newpage
\section{Input Formats}\label{sec:InputFormats}

\textit{Fiona} can have \textit{oWFN}s and \textit{operating guidelines} as its input. The following subsections describe the corresponding file formats. 

\subsection{\textit{oWFN} File Format}\label{subsec:oWFNFileFormat}

An open workflow net is a Petri net with an \textit{interface}, i.e. two additional sets of places:
\textit{input places} and \textit{output places}. Additionally an open workflow net has a set of
final markings. To represent \textit{oWFN}s the \textit{LoLA}-format was extended to implement this
class of petri nets. Following is an example for a valid \textit(oWFN) file.
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
{ sample oWFN }

PLACES
  INTERNAL
    p1,
    p2;
  INPUT
    a;
  OUTPUT
    x,
    y,
    z;

INITIALMARKING
  p1:  2;

FINALCONDITION
  p2 = 4 AND ALL_OTHER_PLACES_EMPTY;

TRANSITION t1
CONSUME
  p1,
  a;
PRODUCE
  p2:2,
  x,
  y,
  z;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Structure of the \textit{oWFN} file format}
The structure of a net is determined by its places, transitions and the edges in between of those.
In the oWFN-Format edges are not seperately defined, but are part of the transition definitions at
the end of the file. An oWFN file consists of 4 sections:

\begin{enumerate}
\item place definitions
\item initial marking
\item final markings
\item transition definitions
\end{enumerate}

Comments in the oWFN code can be written in between \texttt{\{} and \texttt{\}}.

\subsubsection{Places}

In the \texttt{PLACES} section the places of the net are specified. Here we distinguish between
\texttt{INTERNAL}, \texttt{INPUT} and \texttt{OUTPUT} places. A \texttt{PLACES} section of a net
looks like this:
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
PLACES
  INTERNAL
    p1,
    p2;
  INPUT
    a;
  OUTPUT
    x,
    y,
    z;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

In this example we have two internal, one input and three output places. The names of the places
must be disjoint over all three categories, thus a place cannot be an input and an output place
at the same time.

After the \texttt{PLACES} follow the \texttt{INITIALMARKING} and \texttt{FINALMARKING} respectively
\texttt{FINALCONDITION} sections, which are explained later on.

\subsubsection{Transitions}
After the three first sections the transitions of the net including their attached edges are defined.
The fourth section does not have a headline like the first three, but rather one for each transition.
A transition definition looks like this:
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
TRANSITION t1
CONSUME
  p1,
  a;
PRODUCE
  p2:2,
  x,
  y,
  z;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

This example defines a transition named \texttt{t1} with six edges. Two that lead from the places
\texttt{p1} and \texttt{a} to the transition and four that lead from the transition to the places
\texttt{p2}, \texttt{x}, \texttt{y} and \texttt{z}, with the edge to \texttt{p2} having a weight of
2. A single place can be present under both \texttt{CONSUME} and \texttt{PRODUCE} in the same
transition, such a structure is called a loop. Any other transitions of the net would just be
listed further with the same syntax, thus starting with the \texttt{TRANSITION} keyword, followed
by the name of the transition followed by the \texttt{CONSUME} and \texttt{PRODUCE} parts
containing places, that must have been defined in the \texttt{PLACES} section beforehand.
\texttt{CONSUME} and \texttt{PRODUCE} are allowed to be empty, thus representing a transition which
is not in any way connected to the rest of the net.

\subsubsection{Initial Marking}
After the \texttt{PLACES} section comes the \texttt{INITIALMARKING} section. Every place which is
not listed in the \texttt{INITIALMARKING} section is implicitly assumed to have zero tokens. If one
wants to create an initial state that differs from all places being empty one has to list places,
which are to contain a number of tokens, in the \texttt{INITIALMARKING} section. Such a section
looks as following:
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
INITIALMARKING
  p1:  2;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

After this definition the place \texttt{p1} would contain two tokens. One can initially mark more
than one place, by seperating the places by commata and finishing the section with a semicolon. If
a place is listed without a colon and the corresponding number of tokens, the \textit{oWFN} file
format implies the place is marked with one token.

\subsubsection{Final Markings}

A final marking is defined either as a \texttt{FINALMARKING} or a \texttt{FINALCONDITION}. The main
difference is that a \texttt{FINALMARKING} can only describe one final state while a
\texttt{FINALCONDITION} can describe multiple final states.
\paragraph{Final Marking}

The \texttt{FINALMARKING} section follows the same syntax as the \texttt{INITIALMARKING} section.
Thus one can list a number of places with corresponding numbers of tokens. The final state
described by a \texttt{FINALMARKING} is meant to be a state in which the marking exactly matches the described
one, including not mentioned places as having a token number of zero. In the same way this means,
that a \texttt{FINALMARKING} can only describe exactly one final state. A final marking looks like
this:
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
FINALMARKING
  p2:  4;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}
This would describe a final state in which the place \texttt{p2} has exactly four tokens and all
other places are empty.

\paragraph{Final Condition}
The syntax of a \tt FINALCONDITION \rm is different from that of a \tt
FINALMARKING \rm. If one wants to express that the place \texttt{p2} has to contain four tokens, the \texttt{FINALCONDITION} would look like
this:
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
FINALCONDITION
  p2 = 4;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

This \texttt{FINALCONDITION} describes any state in which there are exactly four tokens on the
place \texttt{p2}. One could have instead used a different relation than equality. The \textit{oWFN} file
format supports equal, not equal, lesser, greater, less or equal and greater or equal. The two
examples are semantically different. While the examplary \texttt{FINALCONDITION} accepts any state
with four tokens on \texttt{p2} as a final state the examplary \texttt{FINALMARKING} only accepts one final
state, and that is where \texttt{p2} has four tokens and all other places have zero tokens. If one wants to
create a \texttt{FINALCONDITION} equal to the exemplary \texttt{FINALMARKING}, one can use the
boolean keywords \texttt{AND}, \texttt{OR} and \texttt{NOT}. The equal definition would then look
as follows:
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
FINALCONDITION
  p2 = 4 AND p1 = 0 AND a = 0 AND
  x = 0 AND y =0 AND z = 0;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

All markings that fullfill the boolean formula are considered a final state of the oWFN. In this
case it is  exactly the same finalstate, as defined by the \texttt{FINALMARKING} with \texttt{p2} containing four tokens
and all other places zero.
It can quickly become a nuisance to write or read such a formula, especially if the \textit{oWFN}s become big. That
is why there is a keyword that can gather up most of the information.
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
FINALCONDITION
  p2 = 4 AND ALL_OTHER_PLACES_EMPTY;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

The meaning of this final condition is exactly the same as of the one mentioned before.
If one requires only the internal places of his oWFN to be empty, one can use the
keyword \texttt{ALL\_OTHER\_INTERNAL\_PLACES\_EMPTY}. Requiring the same for the external
places only (that are all non-internal or interface places) can be achieved
with the keyword \texttt{ALL\_OTHER\_EXTERNAL\_PLACES\_EMPTY}.

All three keywords can be combined at will. Saying
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
FINALCONDITION p2 = 4 AND ALL_OTHER_INTERNAL_PLACES_EMPTY 
					  AND ALL_OTHER_EXTERNAL_PLACES_EMPTY;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

is the same as
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
FINALCONDITION p2 = 4 AND ALL_OTHER_PLACES_EMPTY;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

All three keywords can only be used as the right hand side of a conjunction
with another state predicate while the whole conjunction is then again a state
predicate. So the rule is

\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
statepredicate := statepredicate 
				  AND ALL_OTHER_PLACES_EMPTY
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

The scope of \texttt{ALL\_OTHER\_PLACES\_EMPTY} is the left hand side of state predicate of
the above conjunction. All places that are not mentioned in the left hand side
predicate are then required to be empty.

For one to decide the scope of \texttt{ALL\_OTHER\_PLACES\_EMPTY}, it is crucial that one
understands all bracing and precedence rules of state predicate formulas and
that one can construct the fully braced form of his formula in his mind!

Suppose a different oWFN with places \texttt{p1}, \texttt{p2}, \texttt{p3}, and \texttt{p4}. Then the formula:
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
FINALCONDITION 
p1 = 1 AND ALL_OTHER_PLACES_EMPTY OR 
p2 = 1 AND ALL_OTHER_PLACES_EMPTY;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}


expands to:
\begin{quote} 

\begin{verbatim}
FINALCONDITION 
(p1 = 1 AND p2 = 0 AND p3 = 0 AND p4 = 0) OR 
(p2 = 1 AND p1 = 0 AND p3 = 0 AND p4 = 0);
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

because \texttt{AND} takes precedence over \texttt{OR}.

In the same oWFN the formula
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim} 
FINALCONDITION 
p1 = 1 AND ALL_OTHER_PLACES_EMPTY AND p2 = 1;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

expands to
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
FINALCONDITION 
p1 = 1 AND p2 = 0 AND p3 = 0 AND p4 = 0 AND p2 = 1;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

because \texttt{AND} is left associative. So the fully braced form of the original
formula is:
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
FINALCONDITION 
(((p1 = 1) AND ALL_OTHER_PLACES_EMPTY) AND (p2 = 1));
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}


Consequently \texttt{(p1 = 1)} is the scope of \texttt{ALL\_OTHER\_PLACES\_EMPTY}. Therefore
\texttt{ALL\_OTHER\_PLACES\_EMPTY} expands to \texttt{((p2 = 0) AND (p3 = 0) AND (p4 = 0))}. 
Putting it all together and removing redundant braces results in
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
FINALCONDITION 
p1 = 1 AND p2 = 0 AND p3 = 0 AND p4 = 0 AND p2 = 1;
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

which is the formula that was stated as the expansion in the first place.

As one might have already noticed, this formula is unsatisfiable because it
requires \texttt{p2} to be empty and marked at the same time. Therefore it is
recommended to use \texttt{ALL\_OTHER\_PLACES\_EMPTY} only at the very end of an n-ary
conjunction (or anywhere along with proper explicit bracing).

The same rules, of course, apply to \texttt{ALL\_OTHER\_INTERNAL\_PLACES\_EMPTY} and
\texttt{ALL\_OTHER\_EXTERNAL\_PLACES\_EMPTY}.

\subsection{File Format OG}\label{subsec:FileFormatOG}

\textit{Fiona} can have the og file format as its input.

The og file consists of 3 sections:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \texttt{NODES}
\item \texttt{INITIALNODE}
\item \texttt{TRANSITIONS}
\end{enumerate}

In the first section, all nodes of the graph are specified. Each definition
contains the node's name and the boolean annotation of the node. Additionally
a color for the node can be provided, which is either red or blue. Red nodes
are those that are not part of the final operating guideline, but rather left
over from building the operating guideline and have not been deleted yet for
diagnosis reasons. Blue nodes are equal to colorless nodes and are part of the
actual operating guideline. The different nodes are divided by commata, a
semicolon finishes the section. 

Every node follows this syntax:
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
nodeName:nodeAnnotation[:nodeColor]
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

In the second section, one of the nodes is determined as \textit{root node} by its name,
the section is finished by a semicolon:
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
nodeName
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}

In the last section all edges of the graph are specified. The different
edges are divided by commata, a semicolon finishes the section. Every edge follows this syntax:

\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
sourceNodeName -> targetNodeName:edgeAnnotation
\end{verbatim}
\end{quote}


Here is an example for a valid og file:
\begin{quote} 
\begin{verbatim}
NODES

The interaction graph shows the states of the service, treating all inner states with the same
further communication behaviour as equal. By analyzing the interaction graph controllability of
the service can be efficiently decided. For more information on interaction graphs see [Wei04].

\item isacyclic
\item count
\end{itemize}
\rm

The operating guideline of a service characterizes every possible behaviour of the service's
environment that leads to a correct execution of the service, thus its termination. Any behaviour
of an environment, that is a subgraph of the operating guideline, includes the root node and fullfills
every nodes boolean annotation is a strategy for this service. For more detailed information on operating
guidelines refer to [MRS05].

\subsection{Limitations}\label{subsec:Limitations}

The current version of \textit{Fiona} has several limitations:

\paragraph{Number of Strategies} The number of strategies, which are determined by the given og
can only be calculated if the og is acyclic and deterministic. It will also hold with a
warning in case the calculation becomes to ressourceful. The complexity of the used algorithm
is not polynomial.

\paragraph{Sequences} oWFNs model asynchronous communication behaviour. Even if the net has already
sent a message - therefore put a token on an output place - there is no mechanism to stop
the net until the message is consumed. Thus a simple sequence of sent messages quickly results
in a large operating guideline, which models every order of the consumption of those sent messages.
Examples can be taken from the \texttt{/tests/sequence\_suite} directory

\subsection{Known Bugs}\label{subsec:KnownBugs}

In the current version of Fiona are the following issues:

\begin{description}
	\item[Problem] The test suite in the current release does not pass all tests. The 'samples' and the 'bddtest' tests do not work properly.
	\item[Solution] The test suite is going to be fixed.
\end{description}
