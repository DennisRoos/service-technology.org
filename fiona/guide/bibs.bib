  abstract = {This document defines a language for specifying business process behavior
    based on Web Services. This language is called Web Services Business
    Process Execution Language (abbreviated to WS-BPEL in the rest of
    this document). Processes in WS-BPEL export and import functionality
    by using Web Service interfaces exclusively.


    Business processes can be described in two ways. Executable business
    processes model actual behavior of a participant in a business interaction.
    Abstract business processes are partially specified processes that
    are not intended to be executed. An Abstract Process may hide some
    of the required concrete operational details. Abstract Processes
    serve a descriptive role, with more than one possible use case,
    including observable behavior and process template. WS-BPEL is meant
    to be used to model the behavior of both Executable and Abstract
    Processes.


    WS-BPEL provides a language for the specification of Executable and
    Abstract business processes. By doing so, it extends the Web Services
    interaction model and enables it to support business transactions.
    WS-BPEL defines an interoperable integration model that should facilitate
    the expansion of automated process integration in both the intracorporate
    and the business-to-business spaces.},

It describes three roles, service provider, service requester, and service broker, together with the three operations publish, find, and bind. We provide a formal method based on Petri nets to model services and their cooperation. We characterize well-behaving pairs of requester's and provider's services and suggest operating guidelines as a convenient and intuitive artifact to realize publish. In our approach, the find operation reduces to a matching problem between the requester's service and the operating guideline. Binding of a requester's and a provider's service is therefore guaranteed to result in a well-behaving cooperating service. At this time, the approach is limited to acyclic Petri nets.},

abstract = {This paper is concerned with the application of Web services to distributed, cross-organizational business processes. In this scenario, it is crucial to answer the following questions: Do two Web services fit together in a way such that the composed system is deadlock-free? - the question of compatibility. Can one Web service be replaced by another while the remaining components stay untouched? - the question of equivalence. Can we reason about the soundness of one given Web service without considering the actual environment it will by used in? This paper defines the notion of usability - an intuitive and locally provable soundness criterion for a given Web services. Based on this notion, this paper demonstrates how the other questions could be answered. The presented method is based on Petri nets, because this formalism is widely used for modeling and analyzing business processes. Due to the existing Petri net semantics for BPEL4WS - a language that is in the very act of becoming the industrial standard for Web service based business processes - the results are directly applicable to real world examples.},
