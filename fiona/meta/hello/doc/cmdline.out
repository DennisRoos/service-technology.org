Usage: hello [OPTIONS]... [FILE]...

About Hello:

  -h, --help               Print help and exit
      --detailed-help      Print help, including all details and hidden 
                             options, and exit
      --full-help          Print help, including hidden options, and exit
  -V, --version            Print version and exit

Input/Output:
  When called without an input file, Hello reads from the standard input 
  stream. When called without an output parameter, Hello writes to the standard 
  output stream. If no filename is given for the output option Hello creates a 
  file with a temporary name.

  -o, --output[=FILENAME]  Wendy's output.
  This option is used when Wendy's output should be stored to a file.


Configuration:
  <<-- Hello relies on several other tools. These options configure Hello to 
  find these tools. -->>

  -c, --config=FILE        Read configuration from file.
  If no file is given, Hello first tries to parse file `hello.conf' from the 
  sysconf directory (usually `/usr/local/etc'; written in case Hello was 
  installed) and then from the current working directory. If neither file was 
  found, the standard values are assumed.

      --wendy=FILENAME     Set the path and binary of Wendy.  (default=`wendy')
  The Wendy binary. Wendy can be downloaded from 
  http://service-technology.org/wendy and compiled using `make wendy'.

      --tmpfile=FILENAME   Set the path and name of temporary files.  
                             (default=`/tmp/hello-XXXXXX')
  The filename Hello should use to create temporary files (i.e., the output 
  derived from Wendy). The filename should end with `XXXXXX' which is replaced 
  at runtime with a random string.

      --noClean            Do not delete temporary files.  (default=off)
  Any temporary files created will be kept after Hello terminates.


Debugging:
  These options control how much debug output Hello creates.

  -v, --verbose            Show verbose messages.  (default=off)
  Show verbose information reporting intermediate steps.

      --bug                Write configuration information into a file 
                             `bug.log'.  (default=off)
  This output file gives information on the machine Hello was configured and 
  compiled which should help to fix bugs. The file `bug.log' should be attached 
  to bug reports.

      --stats              Display time and memory consumption on termination.  
                             (default=off)
  The time is measured using the function clock(3). The memory usage is 
  measured using the ps(1) command. Note that memory consumption contains a 
  small overhead.
