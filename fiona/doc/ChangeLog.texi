@heading Version 3.0

@itemize
@item Fiona now supports more service analysis scenarios
@itemize
@item given an og-file Fiona generates a public view
@item given two or more open nets such that there composition does not behave well, Fiona can generate an adapter -- either a rather small adapter or a most permissive adapter
@item Fiona is able to read adapter rules from file
@item given an open net file, Fiona can generate a partner open net for the given net - either a rather small partner or a most permissive one is generated
@end itemize

@item implemented powerful preprocessing and conversion functionalities for open nets and OGs
@itemize
@item minimization of a given OG
@item structural reduction of given open nets (reduction level can be set via command line)
@item normalization of given open nets
@item generation of png files of given open nets, OGs and IGs
@item given an OG, check for nodes that violate their own annotation
@item given an OG, removal of nodes that violate their own annotation
@item test, if given OG contains cycles
@item counting the number of strategies characterized by a given OG
@end itemize

@item Fiona reads a given OG File for further processing

@item the prefix of the output files can be set by command line

@item Fiona may run in quite mode, i.e., produces no output files

@item it is possible to tell Fiona not to generate a png-file and/ or not to generate any dot related output

@item in case of calculating an reduced IG, it is now possible to choose which reduction technique is used via command line

@item we optimized our algorithms resulting in a faster and more efficient computation of IG and OG

@item it is possible to disable assertions and to disable calls to trace functions, which makes the computation a lot faster (type @samp{./configure --disable-assert})

@item option @option{--bug} prints out detailed system and compilation information to better trace down bugs
