@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

This documentation presents Fiona, a tool to analyze the interaction of services. Its features cover the check of controllability and the construction of an operating guideline of a service as well as other derived notions. @i{Controllability} [1,2] is a minimal correctness criterion of a service stating the existence of a behaviorally compatible partner for the service. An @i{operating guideline} (OG) [3] of a service is an operational characterization of @i{all} behaviorally compatible partners of this service. As a formal model for services Fiona uses @i{open nets} [4,3], a special class of Petri nets that extend classical Petri nets by an interface for communication with other open nets.

The development of Fiona started in 2006 as a reimplementation of a tool called Wombat (available at @url{http://www.informatik.hu-berlin.de/top/wombat}). Wombat was designed to constructively decide controllability of an open net (called workflow module in Wombat). The main reasons for a reimplementation were (1) a completely new theoretical foundation for deciding controllability, (2) a desired focus on efficiency rather than mere effectiveness, (3) the newly developed concept of an operating guideline, and, thus, (4) the need for a separation of computing compatible interactions from reduction rules to ensure efficiency of the algorithms.

Currently, Fiona is developed distributedly by the groups of Wolfgang Reisig (Humboldt-Universit@"at zu Berlin, Germany) and Karsten Wolf (University of Rostock, Germany). It is maintained by Daniela Weinberg, Peter Massuthe, and Karsten Wolf (coordinator).

Fiona is released as free software under the terms of the GNU General Public License. It is written in C++ and its distribution is based on the GNU autotools, which provide the possibility to run Fiona on most operating systems. It compiles on Microsoft Windows (with Cygwin), UNIX (Solaris), Linux, and Mac OS X.

The functionality of Fiona comprises (among others) the following main analysis scenarios:

@itemize
@item @b{Controllability.} Controllability of an open net @math{N} is decided by synthesizing a partner of @math{N} (as an automaton called @i{interaction graph} (IG) [2]). If no partner can be synthesized (i.e., the IG is empty), then @math{N} is uncontrollable.

@item @b{Operating guideline.} An operating guideline (OG) [3] is a finite characterization of @i{all} behaviorally compatible partners by annotating a single partner (as automaton) with Boolean formulae in order to derive all other partners.

@item @b{Matching.} Given an open net @math{M} and an operating guideline @math{OG_N} of an open net @math{N}, Fiona decides whether @math{M} is behaviorally compatible to @math{N} by matching @math{M} with @math{OG_N}. Matching is more efficient than composing the two nets and model checking the composition (as proposed by other approaches, like the @i{public view} approach).

@item @b{Partner synthesis.} Given an open net @math{N}, Fiona computes a behaviorally compatible partner open net @math{M} (if possible). The synthesis can be triggered to construct a small @math{M} (with respect to communication) or a partner @math{M} which exhaustively communicates with @math{N}.
@end itemize

Fiona is a stand-alone tool, designed to be used as a background service of existing service modeling tools. Therefore, Fiona has no graphical interface -- the analysis task as well as the input file(s) are given to Fiona via command line options. Fiona then computes and reports the result and, if needed, generates the output file(s).

@node First Steps
@chapter First Steps

@section Setup and Installation

@enumerate
@item Go to @url{http://service-technology.org/files/fiona} and download the latest release version of Fiona, say @file{fiona-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz}. To setup and compile Fiona, change into your download directory and type

@cartouche
@smallexample
tar xfz fiona-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
cd fiona-@value{VERSION}
./configure
make
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

After compilation, a binary @samp{src/fiona} is generated.@footnote{On Microsoft Windows, the file will be called @file{fiona.exe}.} If you experience any compiler warnings, don't panic: Fiona contains some generated or third party code that we cannot influence.

@item To test whether everything went fine, type

@cartouche
@smallexample
make check
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

to execute the testcases located in @file{tests}. If everything went fine, you should see something like:

@smallexample
===================
All 20 tests passed
===================
@end smallexample

If an error occurs, please send the output to @email{fiona@@service-technology.org}.

@item To install the binary, the manpage, and the documentation, type

@cartouche
@smallexample
make install
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

You might need superuser permissions to do so.
@end enumerate

If you need any further information, see file @file{INSTALL} for detailed instructions.


@section Contents of the Distribution

The distribution contains several directories:

@table @file
@item doc
The Texinfo documentation of Fiona. The documentation can be created using @samp{make pdf}.

@item exp
Experiments and case studies published in several papers. For each file, say @file{bpm2008.tar.gz}, a Makefile target @samp{bpm2008} exists. You can run all experiments with @samp{make experiments}.

@item man
The manpage of Fiona which can be displayed using @samp{man fiona} after having Fiona installed (see Installation description above).

@item maintainer
Some scripts for maintainers of Fiona which can be used to create and distribute releases.

@item src
The source code of Fiona.

@item tests
Testcases for Fiona which check the generated binary.
@end table

@node Command Line Options
@chapter Invoking Fiona

Fiona is a command line tool and does not come with a fancy GUI. However, Fiona can be easily scripted and combined with other tools.

@section Command Line Options

For an overview of the command line options, type @samp{fiona -h} to see the following help screen:

@smallexample
todo
@end smallexample

@node ChangeLog
@chapter Version History

Fiona is developed under the ``Release Early, Release Often'' maxime (see @url{http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html}): Whenever enough integrated or a non-trivial changes have summed up, a new version is published. Though this releases might now always mark significant changes, they at least allow to quickly fix bugs and avoid infinite procrastination.
