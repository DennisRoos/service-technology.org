Version 3.1-unreleased
======================

* adapted code to avoid deprecation warnings of GCC 4.2

* ChangeLogs are now generated from Texinfo documentation

* test cases using Graphviz Dot or Petrify are now skipped if the configure
  script did not find these tools

* fixed bug #12530 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12530'): the CUDD package is now
  entirely translated with a C++ compiler to allow linking of the `new' logger
