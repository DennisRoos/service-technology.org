About Safira:

  -h, --help               Print help and exit
      --detailed-help      Print help, including all details and hidden 
                             options, and exit
      --full-help          Print help, including hidden options, and exit
  -V, --version            Print version and exit
  -v, --verbose            Show verbose output  (default=off)
      --clean              Any temporary files created by Safira are deleted 
                             once they are not used any more.  (default=off)
      --noClean            Do not delete temporary files.  (default=off)

 Group: operations
  Choose the default strategy of the configuration interface. Either, 
  transitions are configured to 'allow' and a configuration only lists the 
  transitions that need to be blocked, or transitions are configured to 'block' 
  and a configuration only lists the transitions that need to be allowed.

  -c, --complement[=MODE]  Complements a given extended annotated service 
                             automaton
                             0 - unreduced result
                             1 - simple reduction algorithm (slow)
                             2 - efficient reduction algorithm (fast)  
                             (possible values="0", "1", "2" default=`2')
  -i, --intersection       Calculates the intersection for two given extended 
                             annotated service automata. Both automato must 
                             have the same interface!
  -u, --union              Calculates the union for two given extended 
                             annotated service automata

Input/Output:
  When called without an input file, Safira reads from the standard input 
  stream.  If 'eaa' doesn't selected as output format Safira will pipe the 
  result to the standard output stream. The input filename's suffix (e.g. 
  '.og') is replaced by the name of the respective option (e.g., '.eaa').

  -o, --output=FORMAT      Select the output file format(s)  (possible 
                             values="eaa", "dot", "png", "pdf", 
                             "eps", "none")
  -t, --time               Mesures the time
