Version 3.2-unreleased
======================

* .

Version 3.1
===========

* implementation of a re-analysis function which is applied to every IG/ OG
  that is computed, therefore after the re-analysis
     * the graph does not contain any isolated blue nodes

     * in case parameter `-s bluenodes' is set, all red nodes are deleted
       from memory

* statistical data of IG/ OG is gathered as the graph is built up and during
  re-analysis

* adapted code to avoid deprecation warnings of GCC 4.2

* ChangeLogs are now generated from Texinfo documentation

* test cases using Graphviz Dot or Petrify are now skipped if the configure
  script did not find these tools

* renamed file `fiona.h' to `config.h'

* used macro `CONFIG_DOT' for Graphviz dot calls to achieve compatibility on
  systems where dot is not available

* Fiona now supports operating guidelines with a global constraint
     * constructing operating guideline with a global constraint (for a given
       owfn-file and a cov-file)

     * matching of an open net with an operating guideline with global
       constraint

* added regression tests to `tests/regression' which can be triggered with
  `make check' in that directory

* made adaptions to the Makefile options to be able to create Mac Universal
  binaries for 64 bit architectures (XCode 3.0 with SDK `MacOSX10.5.sdk' is
  needed)

* added Makefiles in directory `maintainer' to organize the distribution of
  the source tarball and binaries for several platforms

* added a script `maintainer/get_petrify.sh' to retrieve precompiled binaries
  of Petrify from `http://www.lsi.upc.edu/~jordicf/petrify/' and install it
  into a user-defined directory

* Fiona can be translated using the LLVM-frontend for GCC (see
  `http://llvm.org/')

* made the shell scripts more portable by using `#!/usr/bin/env bash' instead
  of `#!/bin/bash' (especially important for FreeBSD systems)

* updated `Doxyfile' and adapted output directories to the other tools (`dox')

* fixed bugs since last version:
     * bug #11905 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?11905'): max occurrences and OGs

     * bug #12101 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12101'): file creation

     * bug #12207 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12207'): parsing OG files with
       reduced arcs

     * bug #12239 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12239'): re-normalization of
       normalized nets

     * bug #12484 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12484'): inconsistent results for
       IG and OG

     * bug #12500 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12500'): combination of `-s
       allnodes' and `-s empty' does not work

     * bug #12530 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12530'): `new'-logger and CUDD
       package

     * bug #12564 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12564'): matching

     * bug #12741 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12741'): wrong numbers with
       parameter `-s rednodes'

     * bug #12765 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12765'): controllability IG/OG

     * bug #12829 (`https://gna.org/bugs/?12829'): IG reduction

Version 3.0
===========

* Fiona now supports more service analysis scenarios
     * given an og-file Fiona generates a public view

     * given two or more open nets such that there composition does not
       behave well, Fiona can generate an adapter - either a rather small
       adapter or a most permissive adapter

     * Fiona is able to read adapter rules from file

     * given an open net file, Fiona can generate a partner open net for the
       given net - either a rather small partner or a most permissive one is
       generated

* implemented powerful preprocessing and conversion functionalities for open
  nets and OGs
     * minimization of a given OG

     * structural reduction of given open nets (reduction level can be set
       via command line)

     * normalization of given open nets

     * generation of png files of given open nets, OGs and IGs

     * given an OG, check for nodes that violate their own annotation

     * given an OG, removal of nodes that violate their own annotation

     * test, if given OG contains cycles

     * counting the number of strategies characterized by a given OG

* Fiona reads a given OG File for further processing

* the prefix of the output files can be set by command line

* Fiona may run in quite mode, i.e., produces no output files

* it is possible to tell Fiona not to generate a png-file and/ or not to
  generate any dot related output

* in case of calculating an reduced IG, it is now possible to choose which
  reduction technique is used via command line

* we optimized our algorithms resulting in a faster and more efficient
  computation of IG and OG

* it is possible to disable assertions and to disable calls to trace
  functions, which makes the computation a lot faster (type `./configure
  --disable-assert')

* option `--bug' prints out detailed system and compilation information to
  better trace down bugs
