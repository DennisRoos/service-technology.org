PURPOSE
    Fiona is a tool designed to check behavioral correctness of a service
    and to analyze the interaction of services in service oriented
    architectures, for instance. It implements very efficient data
    structures and algorithms, which have partly been adapted from
    the Petri net model-checker LoLA. Fiona has been proven to be
    applicable in practice by service designers, service publishers,
    and service brokers.
