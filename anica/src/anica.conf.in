# Configuration file for @PACKAGE_STRING@
# @configure_input@

# This file configures the paths to binaries needed by Anica. The configure
# script already tried to suggest paths, but its entries might have been left
# empty. In that case, you need to manually add the path to the respective
# tool.

# Anica needs a Lola binary. Such a Lola binary can be built by executing
# "make lola-statepredicate1" using a recent Lola distribution, available at 
# http://service-technology.org/files/lola

lola = @lola@

# Anica needs to create a temporary file to pass it to Lola. The filename
# anica should use can be specified below. The filename should end with
# 'XXXXXX' which is replaced at runtime with a random string.

tmpfile = /tmp/anica-XXXXXX
