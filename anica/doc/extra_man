[EXIT STATUS]
Anica exits with 0 on success, and with 1 if an error occurs. See Texinfo manual for detailed information. Note that the exit code is not correlated to the controllability result.

[FILES]
Unless a configuration file is explicitly given using the
.B --config
parameter, Anica first tries to parse file
.I anica.conf
from the sysconf directory (usually `/usr/local/etc') and then from the current working directory.

[REPORTING BUGS]
If you experience a bug, please execute
.IP
hello --bug
.PP
and send the generated file
.I anica.conf
together with a description of the problem to
.B anica@service-technology.org.
