@chapter First Steps

@section Setup and Installation

@enumerate
@item Go to @url{http://service-technology.org/files/safira} and download the latest release version of Safira, say @file{safira-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz}. To setup and compile Safira, change into your download directory and type

@cartouche
@smallexample
tar xfz safira-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
cd safira-@value{VERSION}
./configure
make
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

After compilation, a binary @samp{src/safira} is generated.@footnote{On Microsoft Windows, the file will be called @file{safira.exe}.} If you experience any compiler warnings, don't panic: Safira contains some generated or third party code that we cannot influence.

@item To test whether everything went fine, type

@cartouche
@smallexample
make check
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

to execute the testcases located in @file{tests}. If everything went fine, you should see something like:@footnote{Some tests use Fiona, Wendy and the Petri Net API Frontend to check whether the calculated operating guidelines are correct. If these tools were not found by the configure script, theses tests are skipped.}

@smallexample

@node ChangeLog
@chapter Version History

Safira is developed under the ``Release Early, Release Often'' maxime (see @url{http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html}): Whenever enough integrated or a non-trivial changes have summed up, a new version is published. Though this releases might now always mark significant changes, they at least allow to quickly fix bugs and avoid infinite procrastination.
