Greta v1.1.5
------------

+ [simulation] fixed several bugs in the simulation code
+ [analysis] algorithm to check for implied scenarios on the branching process of an oclet system
+ [interface] check soundness of free-choice process and generate counter-example trace in graphical editor
+ [interface] build branching processes from parameterized models
+ [interface] build branching process of Petri nets (.ptnet)
* [unfolding algorithm] options made member variables: can be set for different BP construction/verification jobs differently
* [unfolding algorithm] to generate all 
* [unfolding algorithm] fixed bug in computation of equivalence relation wrt. cut-off events
* [synthesis] removing parallel transitions with the same label in synthesized net
+ [interface] statistics to print size of computed prefix
+ [interface] added support to print specifications via Eclipse printing API
* [interface] move Wizards to 'Adaptive System' category

Greta v1.1.4
------------

+ added synthesis of (unlabeled) Petri nets
* the generated branching process is now also written to an EMF-based Petri net format (hub.top.editor.ptnetLoLA) for manipulation
* restructured menus and inner organization of UI
* refactoring of functionality, additional analysis functionality has been moved to plugin hub.top.GRETA.run.ext to reduce dependencies of hub.top.GRETA.run

Greta v1.1.3
------------

+ improved simulation controls and rendering of the simulated process in the editor
+ fixed bugs for improving stability of the editor and the simulation engine


Greta v1.1.2
------------

+ construction of state-space/branching process is now encapsulated in an
  Eclipse job allowing concurrent use of Eclipse/Greta during the
  calculation (preferably on a machine with 2 or more cores)
+ re-arranged Greta toolbars and menus
+ added functionality for instantiating parameterized models, currently only
  one parameter is supported, the parameter value is fixed in the code, a
  dialog prompting for the value will be added soon 

Greta v1.1.1
------------

+ added Eclipse feature declaration, Greta can now be installed as an Eclipse
  feature from http://download.gna.org/service-tech/greta/updatesite/
+ added method to construct the minimal complete prefix of the branching
  process of a set of oclets, the generated branching process is written
  as a dot graph to a file in the workspace
+ added Petrify/Genet output, when generating the state space, the output
  is also generated in the input format of Petrify/Genet for net synthesis
+ added state space generation method, the generated state-space is written 
  as dot graph to a file in the workspace
+ added some methods to check structural properties of a system specification,
  the analysis results are currently printed to a message window
  
Greta v1.1.0
------------

+ migrated diagram code to GMF 2.1


Greta v1.0.0
------------

+ initial release
