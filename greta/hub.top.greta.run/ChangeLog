Greta v1.1.3
------------

+ improved simulation controls and rendering of the simulated process in the editor
+ fixed bugs for improving stability of the editor and the simulation engine


Greta v1.1.2
------------

+ construction of state-space/branching process is now encapsulated in an
  Eclipse job allowing concurrent use of Eclipse/Greta during the
  calculation (preferably on a machine with 2 or more cores)
+ re-arranged Greta toolbars and menus
+ added functionality for instantiating parameterized models, currently only
  one parameter is supported, the parameter value is fixed in the code, a
  dialog prompting for the value will be added soon 

Greta v1.1.1
------------

+ added Eclipse feature declaration, Greta can now be installed as an Eclipse
  feature from http://download.gna.org/service-tech/greta/updatesite/
+ added method to construct the minimal complete prefix of the branching
  process of a set of oclets, the generated branching process is written
  as a dot graph to a file in the workspace
+ added Petrify/Genet output, when generating the state space, the output
  is also generated in the input format of Petrify/Genet for net synthesis
+ added state space generation method, the generated state-space is written 
  as dot graph to a file in the workspace
+ added some methods to check structural properties of a system specification,
  the analysis results are currently printed to a message window
  
Greta v1.1.0
------------

+ migrated diagram code to GMF 2.1
