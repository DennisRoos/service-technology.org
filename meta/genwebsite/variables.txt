PURPOSE - "Wendy is a tool to synthesize partners for services. This includes a finite characterization of all partners (called "operating guidelines"). Wendy uses a vast set of reduction rules to synthesize (small) partners. These rules may, however, not preserve all partners of the service under consideration, but will synthesize a partner if one exists."
