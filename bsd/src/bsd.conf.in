# Configuration file for @PACKAGE_STRING@
# @configure_input@

# This file configures the paths to binaries needed by BSD. The configure
# script already tried to suggest paths, but its entries might have been left
# empty. In that case, you need to manually add the path to the respective
# tool.

# BSD needs a LoLA binary that builds complete unreduced state spaces. Such
# a LoLA binary can be built by executing "make lola-statspace" using a recent
# LoLA distribution, available at http://service-technology.org/files/lola.
# See file REQUIREMENTS for more information.

lola = @LOLA@

# BSD needs to create a temporary file to pass it to LoLA. The filename
# BSD should use can be specified below. The filename should end with
# 'XXXXXX' which is replaced at runtime with a random string. In case you use
# MinGW, path names are ignored and the basename is used instead.

tmpfile = /tmp/bsd-XXXXXX
