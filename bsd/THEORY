BSD implements several algorithms and result published in several scientific
articles.

BSD automata
============

BSD's main function is to generate BSD automata from given OWFN and a bound b.

The nets reachability graph is calculated by lola and used to compute the BSD
automata. If two OWFN are given then BSD computes both nets' BSD automata and
answers the question of net A being a br-controller of net B or vice versa.
Therefore Net A and B have to be composable and the composition has to be a
closed net.
