BSD implements several algorithms and result published in several scientific
articles.

BSD automata
============

BSD's main function is to generate BSD__b_ and CSD__b_ automata from given
OWFN and a bound _b_. BSD can also check if two nets are _b_-partners or if
they _b_-conform.

The nets reachability graph is calculated by lola and used to compute the
BSD__b_ and CSD__b_ automata. DOT files are generated as output.

Two BSD__b_ automata BSD__b_(_A_) and BSD__b_(_B_) given as DOT files can be
given as input to answer the question of net _A_ being a _b_-partner of net
_B_ or vice versa. The underlying nets _A_ and _B_ have to be composable and
the composition _A+B_ has to be a closed net.

Two CSD__b_ automata CSD__b_(_implication_) and CSD__b_(_specification_) given
as DOT files can be given as input to answer the question of net _implication_
_b_-conforms to net _specification_. The underlying nets _implication_ and
_specification_ have to have the same interfaces.
