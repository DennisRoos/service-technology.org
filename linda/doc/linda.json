"maintainer": "Jan Sürmeli", 
"tagline": "Computing communication fingerprints of services", 
"purpose": "Linda computes a *fingerprint* of a service. A fingerprint abstracts away from any control flow, and merely describes the linear dependencies of the number of certain event occurrences. This abstract representation of a service may be used for compatibility quick checks to boost performance during service discovery. You can find more information in the [science section](science.html). Linda provides the input for [Yasmina](../yasmina)", 
"license": "AGPL3+", 
"science" : "You may read more about the theory behind Linda, and find a case study [in this paper (Oanea, Sürmeli, Wolf, *ICSOC 2010*)](../yasmina/experiments)."
