                COverability graphs for Reachability Analysis

PURPOSE
    From a Petri net Cora generates a (partial) coverability graph and splits 
	the graph's nodes for the purpose of either solving the reachability problem 
	for a given final marking or finding a firing sequence leading to a given
	node in the graph.
