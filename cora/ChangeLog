Version 0.3-unreleased (30 Jul 2010)
====================================

* updated the Petri Net API 4.02 (revision r5970)

* added algorithm for pumping unfirable sequences to firables ones, to
  check coverability

* added documentation

* separated input/output from functionality

Version 0.2-unreleased (13 Jul 2010)
====================================

* added partial documentation

Version 0.1-unreleased (13 Jul 2010)
====================================

* first version of Cora

* tests reachability based on the coverability graph by splitting nodes

* computes a firable sequence to a given node

* computes and print the full coverability graph on demand (only)
