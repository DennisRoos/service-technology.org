PURPOSE
Cora implements several algorithms and result published in several scientific
articles.  Cora constructs a portion of a coverability graph to decide
reachability, find a firable sequence to a node of the coverability graph, or
print the full coverability graph.

The Coverability Graph
======================

Coverability Graph and Coverability Tree go back a long way.

     R.M. Karp, R.E. Miller. Parallel Program Schemata. Journal of Computer
     and System Sciences 3, pp.147-195, 1969.

Coverability Graphs are not unique and may vary in size (for the same net)
depending on the construction algorithm. While there is a minimal one, other
variants may be faster to implement and/or have faster runtimes.

     A. Finkel. The Minimal Coverability Graph for Petri Nets. Lecture Notes
     in Computer Science 674, pp.210-243, 1993.

Cora uses a simple algorithm here as the main computing power goes into a
splitting algorithm for the coverability graph's nodes while the construction
of nodes is minimized using partial order reduction.

The Reachability Problem
========================

The Reachability problem is known to be decidable since the early 1980's,
which was shown independently by two researchers.

     E. Mayr. An Algorithm for the General Petri Net Reachability Problem.
     SIAM Journal of Computing 13:3, pp.441-460, 1984.

     S.R. Kosaraju. Decidability of Reachability in Vector Addition Systems.
     Proceedings of the 14th Annual ACM STOC, pp.267-281, 1982.

Later, a different (possibly better) presentation of the topic was given.

     J.L. Lambert. A Structure to Decide Reachability in Petri Nets.
     Theoretical Computer Science 99, pp.79-104, 1992.

For those firm in the German language, a version with additional explanation
and a running example can also be found in the book

     H.Wimmel. Entscheidbarkeit bei Petri Netzen. Springer, ISBN
     978-3-540-85470-8, 2008.

Stubborn Sets
=============

Since the coverability graph has no upper limit on its size in relation to its
Petri net, it is a good idea to use optimisations to reduce redundancy with
respect to the goal. If that goal is testing reachability, partial order
reductions are a good approach. Cora implements a stubborn set method.
