[EXIT STATUS]
Candy exits with 0 on success, and with 1 if an error occurs. See Texinfo manual for detailed information.

[EXAMPLES]
To calculate cost efficient partners of an operating guideline `partners.og'
with costs `costs.cf', execute
.IP
candy --input=partners.og --costfile=costs.cf
.PP
The output will be written to the file `partners_efficient.og'.

[FILES]
Unless a configuration file is explicitly given using the
.B --config
parameter, Candy first tries to parse file
.I candy.conf
from the sysconf directory (usually `/usr/local/etc') and then from the current working directory.

[REPORTING BUGS]
If you experience a bug, please execute
.IP
candy --bug
.PP
and send the generated file
.I candy.conf
together with a description of the problem to
.B candy@service-technology.org.
