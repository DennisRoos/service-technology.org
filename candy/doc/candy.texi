@node First Steps
@chapter First Steps

@section Setup and Installation

@enumerate
@item Go to @url{http://service-technology.org/files/candy} and download the latest release version of Candy, say @file{candy-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz}. To setup and compile Candy, change into your download directory and type

@cartouche
@smallexample
tar xfz candy-@value{VERSION}.tar.gz
cd candy-@value{VERSION}
./configure
make
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

After compilation, a binary @samp{src/candy} is generated.@footnote{On Microsoft Windows, the file will be called @file{candy.exe}.} If you experience any compiler warnings, don't panic: Candy contains some generated or third party code that we cannot influence.

@item To test whether everything went fine, type

@cartouche
@smallexample
make check
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

to execute the testcases located in @file{tests}. If everything went fine, you
should see something like:@footnote{Some tests use Wendy to check whether the
calculated operating guidelines are correct. If Wendy was not found by the configure script, theses tests are skipped.}

@smallexample
## ------------- ##
## Test results. ##
## ------------- ##

All 32 tests were successful.
@end smallexample

If an error occurs, please send the output to @email{candy@@service-technology.org}.

@item To install the binary, the manpage, and the documentation, type

@cartouche
@smallexample
make install
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

You might need superuser permissions to do so.
@end enumerate

If you need any further information, see file @file{INSTALL} for detailed instructions.


@section Contents of the Distribution

The distribution contains several directories:

@table @file
@item doc
The Texinfo documentation of Candy. The documentation can be created using
@samp{make pdf}. Note you need to have Candy properly installed before (see installation description above).

@item man
The manpage of Candy which can be displayed using @samp{man candy} after having
Candy installed (see installation description above).

@item src
The source code of Candy.

@item tests
Testcases for Candy which check the generated binary. Some test scripts use
Wendy to calculated operating guidelines. If
Wendy was not found by the configure script, theses tests are skipped.
@end table

@section Requirements
@anchor{Requirements}

@c !!! DO NOT CHANGE THE NEXT LINE -- IT IS USED AS A FILTER IN SCRIPTS !!!
In order to run, compile, and develop Candy, several tools are required.

@subsection Compilation
To compile the source code from a source distribution, the following tools are required.

@itemize
@item GCC (@url{http://gcc.gnu.org/})
@item @acronym{GNU} Make (@url{http://www.gnu.org/software/make/})
@end itemize


@subsection Development
In case you want to make changes to the source code, the following tools are
required to reconfigure and compile Candy.

@itemize
@item Autoconf, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/}
@item Automake, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/}
@item Bison, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/}
@item flex, @url{http://flex.sourceforge.net/}
@item Gengetopt, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/gengetopt/}
@item help2man, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/}
@item Texinfo, @url{http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/}
@end itemize

@node Command Line Options
@chapter Invoking Candy

Candy is a command line tool and does not come with a fancy @acronym{GUI}. However, Candy can be easily scripted and combined with other tools.

@section Command Line Options

For an overview of the command line options, type @samp{candy -h} to see the following help screen:

@smallexample
@verbatiminclude cmdline.out
@end smallexample


@section Configuration Files

The parameters can also be controlled using a configuration file that can be read using the @samp{config} option; for example:

@cartouche
@smallexample
candy net.owfn --config=myconf.conf
@end smallexample
@end cartouche

A configuration file consistes of @code{paramter = value} lines, each line setting the value of a parameter. Note: If not all parameters are defined, the standard values apply.

The configure script creates a default configuration file @file{candy.conf}
which located in the @file{src} folder. When installing Candy, this is copied to your sysconfig directory (usually @file{/usr/local/etc}).

When Candy is executed, it evaluates parameters as follows:
@enumerate
@item When a configuration file is given via @option{--config}, it is used.
@item Otherwise, the configuration file @file{candy.conf} in the local directory is used if present.
@item Otherwise, the configuration file @file{candy.conf} in the sysconf directory (usually @file{/usr/local/etc}) is used if present.
@item Otherwise, no configuration file is used.
@end enumerate
Parameters given via command-line will overwrite parameters given via configuration files.

@node Exit and Error Codes
@chapter Exit and Error Codes


@section Exit Codes

Candy will exit with code @samp{0} in case everything went fine. In case any error occurs, the exit code will be @samp{1} and an error message with an error code (see below) will be printed to the standard error stream.


@section Error Codes

In case any error occurs, Candy aborts with exit code @samp{1} and prints a message with an error code to the standard error stream.

@table @asis
@item #01
Error opening the input open net or input file not found.

@smallexample
@cartouche
candy: could not open file `foo.owfn' -- aborting [#01]
@end cartouche
@end smallexample

@node ChangeLog
@chapter Version History

@c !!! DO NOT CHANGE THE NEXT LINE -- IT IS USED AS A FILTER IN SCRIPTS !!!
Candy is developed under the ``Release Early, Release Often'' maxime (see @url{http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html}): Whenever enough integrated or a non-trivial changes have summed up, a new version is published. Though this releases might not always mark significant changes, they at least allow to quickly fix bugs and avoid infinite procrastination.
