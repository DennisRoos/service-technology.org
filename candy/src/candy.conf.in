# Configuration file for @PACKAGE_STRING@
# @configure_input@

# This file configures the paths to binaries needed by Candy. The configure
# script already tried to suggest paths, but its entries might have been left
# empty. In that case, you need to manually add the path to the respective
# tool.

# The filename Candy should use for temporary files can be specified below.
# The filename should end with 'XXXXXX' which is replaced at runtime with a
# random string. In case you use MinGW, path names are ignored and the basename
# is used instead.

tmpfile = /tmp/candy-XXXXXX
