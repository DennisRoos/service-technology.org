Documentation of the TestSuite for soundess of UML2oWFN

The Test-Suite contains the following processes.

TestSuite_soundness.BOMcncpt1__ProcessPinDisjointStopEnd_sound_stop
TestSuite_soundness.BOMcncpt1__ProcessPinDisjoint_sound_ifStop
TestSuite_soundness.BOMcncpt1__TaskCallPinDisjointProc_sound_stop
TestSuite_soundness.BOMcncpt1__TaskCallPinDisjointProc_stop
TestSuite_soundness.BOMcncpt1__TaskPinDisjointProc_sound_stop
TestSuite_soundness.BOMcncpt1__TaskPinDisjointProc_stop
TestSuite_soundness.BOMcncpt__ForkJoin_sound
TestSuite_soundness.BOMcncpt__InclusiveOr2_sound
TestSuite_soundness.BOMcncpt__InclusiveOr_sound_nonsafe
TestSuite_soundness.BOMcncpt__ProcessSimple_sound
TestSuite_soundness.BOMcncpt__Repository_sound
TestSuite_soundness.StpvsEnd__StopvsEnd_1_nonsound
TestSuite_soundness.StpvsEnd__StopvsEnd_1b_sound_nonsafe
TestSuite_soundness.StpvsEnd__StopvsEnd_2_sound_ifStop

The names are meaningful with the following semantics:

_sound:

The process is sound.


_stop:

The process contains a stop-node.


_sound_ifStop:

The process is sound if the semantics of stop nodes (removing all tokens)
is considered when checking soundness. Otherwise the process is probably
not sound.


_sound_nonsafe:

The process satisfies reachability of the final state while having no tokens
left in the inner of the process, but the process is not 1-safe.


_nonsound:

The process is not sound.
