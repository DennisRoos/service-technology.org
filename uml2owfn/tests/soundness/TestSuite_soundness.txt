Documentation of the TestSuite for soundess of UML2oWFN

The Test-Suite contains the following processes.

TestSuite_soundness.UMLcncpt__XOR_sound
TestSuite_soundness.UMLcncpt__ORsplit_sound
TestSuite_soundness.UMLcncpt__ORsplit_uls
TestSuite_soundness.UMLcncpt__ProcessSimple_sound
TestSuite_soundness.UMLcncpt__Repository_sound

TestSuite_soundness.UMLcncpt1__ProcessPinDisjointStopEnd_sound_stop
TestSuite_soundness.UMLcncpt1__ProcessPinDisjoint_sound_ifStop
TestSuite_soundness.UMLcncpt1__ProcessPinOverlap_udl_stop
TestSuite_soundness.UMLcncpt1__TaskCallPinDisjointProc_sound_stop
TestSuite_soundness.UMLcncpt1__TaskPinDisjointProc_sound_stop

TestSuite_soundness.UMLStpvsEnd__StopvsEnd_1_ull
TestSuite_soundness.UMLStpvsEnd__StopvsEnd_1b_uls
TestSuite_soundness.UMLStpvsEnd__StopvsEnd_2_sound_ifStop

The names are meaningful with the following semantics:

_sound:

The process is sound.


_stop:

The process contains a stop-node.


_sound_ifStop:

The process is sound if the semantics of stop nodes (removing all tokens)
is considered when checking soundness. Otherwise the process is probably
not sound.


_uls:

The proces is unsound because it has a lack of synchronization
(i.e. the resulting Petri net is not safe).


_udl:

The process is unsound, because it has a deadlock, i.e. the process cannot terminate.


_ull:

The process is unsound, because it has a livelock, i.e. the process cannot terminate
but still performs actions in an infinite loop which it cannot leave.
