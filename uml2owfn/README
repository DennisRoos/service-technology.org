        Translating IBM WebSphere Business Process Models to Petri Nets
                 http://www.service-technology.org/uml2owfn/


PURPOSE

    UML2oWFN implements a standard compiler for translating IBM WebSphere
    Business Process Models to Petri Nets. In addition UML2oWFN can generate
    Petri Nets for soundness analysis with the model checker LoLA and the
    soundness checker Woflan.
