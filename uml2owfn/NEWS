        Translating IBM WebSphere Business Process Models to Petri Nets
                 http://www.service-technology.org/uml2owfn/

Version 2.10-unreleased
=======================

* Migrated UML2oWFN to the new Petri net API. The included PNAPI slightly
  deviates from the original API, see SVN repository for details.

* Dropped support for several file formats. The currently supported file
  formats are .lola, .owfn, .dot, and .tpn (Woflan)

* Changed the filenames of the LoLA binaries for soundness analysis to
  `lola-bpm-liveprop1' and `lola-bpm-statepredicate1'

* Role cutting functionality has been disabled.

 
See file ChangeLog <http://service-technology.org/files/uml2owfn/ChangeLog>
