Version 2.00-unreleased
=======================

* Re-implementation of the compiler frontend.

* Local sub processes and loops are now treated as simple tasks in the parent
  process. Each subprocess and each loop is added as a process to the list of
  all output-processes.

* Processes can be cut according to the role information using new options
     * `--rolecut', cut away all roles that do not include a startnode

     * `--rolecontains=ROLE', additionally keep those roles

     * `--rolexclusively=ROLE', delete all roles, that are not covered by a
       startnode or by a containrole, that do not match the set of exclusive
       roles

* Added generation of FINALCONDITION for oWFN output; oWFN ouput now uses
  full node names instead of short node names.

* Bugfix: Updated generation of formula for safe states to consider
  post-places of transitions that lie on a cycle of the net as well.

* Modified semantics of workflow net termination semantics (parameter `-a
  wfNet') which now assumes that the net terminates with a global orJoin and
  tries to extend the given net to a single terminal workflow net. The log
  file (`-p log') will contain an entry of this extension does not preserve
  soundness.

* Made filtering of processes more precise according to the semantics
  implemented in the WebSphere tools, providing a dedicated filtering
  parameter for different process characteristics:
     * Translation may filter empty processes (`-s empty'),

     * processes with pin multiplcities (`-s multi'),

     * processes with non-matching pin multiplicities at edges (produce one
       token, consume two token, `-s multiNonMatching'),

     * processes with overlapping pinsets (`-s overlappingPins'), and

     * processes with trivial communication interfaces (`-s
       trivialInterface', only applicable if using `--rolecut').
  The old parameter `-p filter' remains for backwards compatibility and
  implements `-s empty -s overlappingPins'.

* Extended the translation log file which now distinguishes properties of UML
  processes and of the Petri nets

* Added `--enable-debug' and `--disable-assert' to `./configure' parameters
  to control the use of debug and assert code

* integrated BOM Anonymizer to UML2oWFN distribution (see directory `anon')
