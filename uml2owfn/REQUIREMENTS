        Translating IBM WebSphere Business Process Models to Petri Nets
                 http://www.service-technology.org/uml2owfn/

In order to run, compile, and develop UML2oWFN, several tools are required.

Runtime
-------

For the standard compiler functionality, no additional tools are required.
For the analysis functionality either LoLA or Woflan are required.

   * LoLA (`http://service-technology.org/lola'), compiled with the
     `STATEPREDICATE' and the `LIVEPROP' options. Suitable LoLA binaries
     can be created as follows:
       1. download `http://service-technology.org/files/lola/lola.tar.gz'

       2. untar `lola.tar.gz', configure

       3. call `make lola-bpm-liveprop1'

       4. copy the binary `src/lola-liveprop1' to a directory of your path
          (e.g., `/usr/local/bin') or call `make install'
       
       5. repeat steps 3 and 4 with `make lola-bpm-statepredicate1'
       
     The corresponding configuration files for LoLA are also stored in 
     the directory `./lola/' of this distribution. Please consult the
     LoLA manual for additional information.          

Compilation
-----------

To compile the source code from a source distribution, the following tools are
required.

   * GCC (`http://gcc.gnu.org/')

   * GNU Make (`http://www.gnu.org/software/make/')

Development
-----------

In case you want to make changes to the source code, the following tools are
required to reconfigure and compile Wendy.

   * Autoconf, `http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/'

   * Automake, `http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/'

   * Bison, `http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/'

   * flex, `http://flex.sourceforge.net/'

   * help2man, `http://www.gnu.org/software/help2man/'

   * Texinfo, `http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/'

`http://service-technology.org/nightly' for the versions we use during
development.
