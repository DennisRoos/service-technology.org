PURPOSE
    oWFN2BPEL introduces a fully-automatic translation of Petri net models
    into abstract BPEL processes which can be refined to executable BPEL
    processes. It combines strengths of Petri nets in modeling and
    verification with the ability to execute BPEL processes. Furthermore, it
    completes the Tools4BPEL framework to synthesize BPEL processes which are
    correct by design.
