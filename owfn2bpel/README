INTRODUCTION
============

oWFN2BPEL introduces a fully-automatic translation of Petri net
models into abstract BPEL processes which can be refined to
executable BPEL processes. It combines strengths of Petri nets
in modeling and verification with the ability to execute BPEL
processes. Furthermore, it completes the Tools4BPEL framework
to synthesize BPEL processes which are correct by design.


CONTENTS
========

README     this file
INSTALL    generic installation instructions
COPYING    the GNU GPL under which oWFN2BPEL is licensed
/src       the source code
/doc       documentation about the translation approach


SETUP
=====

To translate, execute

   ./configure
   make

For more information on the configuration and translation,
read the file INSTALL.


EXECUTION
=========

To translate a model, say "process.owfn" into a BPEL process,
you have to execute oWFN2BPEL with

    owfn2bpel -i process.owfn -o process.bpel

to generate a file "process.bpel".


DOCUMENTATION
=============

The folder "doc" contains two documents: a German diploma
thesis ("Kleine_2007.doc") describing the whole translation
approach in detail. Furthermore, an English research paper
("LohmannKleine_2008.pdf") describes the translation more
briefly and compares it with other translation approaches.
