purpose "oWFN2BPEL introduces a fully-automatic translation of Petri net models into abstract BPEL processes which can be refined to executable BPEL processes. It combines strengths of Petri nets in modeling and verification with the ability to execute BPEL processes. Furthermore, it completes the Tools4BPEL framework to synthesize BPEL processes which are correct by design."
