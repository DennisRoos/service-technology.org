# This file configures the paths to binaries needed by Marlene. The configure
# script already tried to suggest paths, but its entries might have been left
# empty. In that case, you need to manually add the path to the respective
# tool.

# Marlene needs a Wendy binary (version 1.4 and above). Recent distribtions
# are available at http://service-technology.org/files/wendy.
