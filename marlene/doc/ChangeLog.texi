Initially planned as 1.2 release, therefore lot of features in this version :)

@itemize

@item support for different properties -- default is deadlock, optional is livelock freedom

@item update to version 4.0 of PNAPI (nets no longer become unbounded when normalized, port support)

@item when building binary for Win32-Systems, path for temporary files is automatically set to %TEMP%

@item added experimental support for Candy (@url{http://service-technology.org/tools/candy})

@item added (highly experimentell) support for building controllers using Genet

@item open nets with synchronous interface are now supported

@item to be more consistent, engine interface is partioned into ports

@item added initial CMake support (all rules, to build binaries, but no documentation or tests)

@item known issues:

@itemize

@item cost-optimization is not fully working

@heading Version 1.1
@itemize

@item changed behavior concerning prefixes: default is no prefixes added to the nets, @samp{--with-prefix} adds a unique prefix to each read net.
      (parameter for invoking prefixes is @samp{--withprefix})

@item added parameter @samp{--engineonly} to get only the engine part of an adapter

@item composition of controller and engine works now (see bug #13968, @url{https://gna.org/bugs/?13968})

@item switched off redution rule `conflictfree transitions' due to counterexamples by Arjan

@end itemize

@heading Version 1.0
@itemize

@item choice whether to use synchronous/asynchronous interface between controller and engine

@item added scripts to use LCOV (@url{http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php}) to determine test case coverage (use @samp{make cover} in @file{tests} directory)

@item support for asynchronouns and synchrouns services (so adapter rules can
  handle message transformation and synchronization)

@item open nets can be read several times in one adaptation step, each read net gets a unique id as prefix

@item added support for chatty and arrogant adapter (@samp{--chatty}/@samp{--arrogant})

@item it is possible to only return the controller part of the adapter (@samp{--controlleronly})
