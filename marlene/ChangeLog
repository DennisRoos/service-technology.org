Version 1.1-tscspecial
======================

Initially planned as 1.2 release, therefore lot of features in this version :)

* support for different properties - default is deadlock, optional is
  livelock freedom

* update to version 4.0 of PNAPI (nets no longer become unbounded when
  normalized, port support)

* when building binary for Win32-Systems, path for temporary files is
  automatically set to %TEMP%

* added experimental support for Candy
  (`http://service-technology.org/tools/candy')

* added (highly experimentell) support for building controllers using Genet

* open nets with synchronous interface are now supported

* to be more consistent, engine interface is partioned into ports

* added initial CMake support (all rules, to build binaries, but no
  documentation or tests)

* known issues:

     * cost-optimization is not fully working



Version 1.1
===========

* changed behavior concerning prefixes: default is no prefixes added to the
  nets, `--with-prefix' adds a unique prefix to each read net.
  (parameter for invoking prefixes is `--withprefix')

* added parameter `--engineonly' to get only the engine part of an adapter

* composition of controller and engine works now (see bug #13968,
  `https://gna.org/bugs/?13968')

* switched off redution rule `conflictfree transitions' due to
  counterexamples by Arjan


Version 1.0
===========

* choice whether to use synchronous/asynchronous interface between controller
  and engine

* added scripts to use LCOV (`http://ltp.sourceforge.net/coverage/lcov.php')
  to determine test case coverage (use `make cover' in `tests' directory)

* support for asynchronouns and synchrouns services (so adapter rules can
  handle message transformation and synchronization)

* open nets can be read several times in one adaptation step, each read net
  gets a unique id as prefix

* added support for chatty and arrogant adapter (`--chatty'/`--arrogant')

* it is possible to only return the controller part of the adapter
  (`--controlleronly')


Version 0.5
===========

* initial release
