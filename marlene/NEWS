Version 1.1-tscspecial
======================

Initially planned as 1.2 release, therefore lot of features in this version :)

* support for different properties - default is deadlock, optional is
  livelock freedom

* update to version 4.0 of PNAPI (nets no longer become unbounded when
  normalized, port support)

* when building binary for Win32-Systems, path for temporary files is
  automatically set to %TEMP%

* added experimental support for Candy
  (`http://service-technology.org/tools/candy')

* added support for building controllers using Genet (which will be default,
  Petrify is still backup)

* open nets with synchronous interface are now supported

* to be more consistent, engine interface is partioned into ports

* added initial CMake support (all rules, to build binaries, but no
  documentation or tests)

* known issues:

     * cost-optimization is not fully working
