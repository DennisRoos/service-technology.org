Version 1.03-unreleased
=======================

* fixed a bug in handling filenames, UML2oWFN can now process files in other
  directories than the current working directory

* added parameter `-a orJoin' to translate process for soundness analysis
  assuming an implicit OR-join on the control-flow

* added parameter `-a wfNet' to translate processes into Aalst-workflow-nets,
  the translation assumes an AND-join on all end- and stop-nodes of the
  process

* added new analysis switch `-a removePinsets' that relaxes the process
  termination semantics by requiring that only the control-flow terminates,
  but that data may still be pending at the process output, and added new
  `scripts/Makefile' target `translateweak' that uses the `-a removePinsets'
  option,

* added parameter `-a safe' to check for safeness of a net using LoLA with
  state predicates, this parameter can be used together with `-a soundness'

* added parameter `-p anon' to anonymize the process output by enumerating
  places (p1, p2, ...) and transitions (t1, t2, ...) before writing to disk

* added log file output for translation, with parameter "-p log" a log file
  (name "uml2owfn_<inputfile>.log") with entries of the form "process name;
  translation successful;reason-for-fail;number of nodes, number of edges,
  average number of incoming edges, average number of outgoing edges" is
  written

* added checks for free-choice nets and for workflow-nets (each node is on a
  path from alpha to omega); this additional Petri net functionality is
  implemented in the class ExtendedWorkflowNet which inherits from PetriNet

* added check whether generated Petri net is empty, if this is the case, then
  the net is translated again without reduction rules, the name is extended
  with a ".unreduced" (if it is still emtpy, then the net is skipped: no net
  file, no analysis, not in script file)

* changed task file naming scheme to 'net.lola.<tasktype>.task'

* worked on bug #12160: PNAPI: Petri net reduction rules do not preserve
  (un)-safeness, disallowing place/transition fusion if places/transitions
  are together in the preset/postset of another transition/place

* overrode the Petri net reduction method in the ExtendedWorkflowNet class,
  now implementing reduce_series_places (level 1) and reduce_identical_places
  (level 3)

* stored reduction level in the `scripts/Makefile' in variable
  `REDUCTION-LEVEL', so the reduction level can be set at the make call

* extended filtering criteria: empty processes are not translated

* fixed bug #12156: UML2oWFN: translation of overlapping pinsets fails,
  `https://gna.org/bugs/?12156'

* added documentation in ./doc/

* added tests to `./tests/', run `make check' to run the test suite
