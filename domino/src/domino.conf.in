# Configuration file for Domino 0.9-unreleased
# src/domino.conf.  Generated from domino.conf.in by configure.

# This file configures the paths to binaries needed by Domino. The configure
# script already tried to suggest paths, but its entries might have been left
# empty. In that case, you need to manually add the path to the respective
# tool.

# Domino needs to create a temporary file to pass it to Diane. The filename
# Domino should use can be specified below. The filename should end with
# 'XXXXXX' which is replaced at runtime with a random string.

tmpfile = /tmp/domino-XXXXXX
