# Configuration file for Hello 1.1-unreleased
# src/hello.conf.  Generated from hello.conf.in by configure.

# This file configures the paths to binaries needed by Hello. The configure
# script already tried to suggest paths, but its entries might have been left
# empty. In that case, you need to manually add the path to the respective
# tool.

# <<-- CHANGE START (needed binaries, etc. in config-file) -->>
# Hello needs a Wendy binary. Such a Wendy binary can be built by executing
# "make wendy" using a recent Wendy distribution, available at 
# http://service-technology.org/files/wendy

wendy = @WENDY@

# Hello needs to create a temporary file to pass it to Wendy. The filename
# Hello should use can be specified below. The filename should end with
# 'XXXXXX' which is replaced at runtime with a random string.
