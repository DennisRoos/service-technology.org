How to build a tool? (e.g. Wendy)

1) checkout at least wendy folder and _build folder
3) build GNU toolchain: go to _build/tarballs folder on terminal and type "make"
4) add _build/local/bin to $PATH variable: go to _build/local/bin folder and type "export PATH=$(pwd):$PATH"
5) add ant script for wendy: copy _build/build.xml to wendy/build.xml
6) build wendy: go to wendy folder and type "ant"
