[EXIT STATUS]
Stacia exits with 0 on success, and with 1 if an error occurs. See Texinfo manual for detailed information. Note that the exit code is not correlated to the result.

[EXAMPLES]
To check the siphon-trap property of a net `test4.owfn', execute
.IP
stacia -c test4.owfn
.PP
The result and a potential witness will be written to stdout.

[FILES]
Unless a configuration file is explicitly given using the
.B --config
parameter, Stacia first tries to parse file
.I stacia.conf
from the sysconf directory (usually `/usr/local/etc') and then from the current working directory.

[REPORTING BUGS]
If you experience a bug, please execute
.IP
stacia --bug
.PP
and send the generated file
.I stacia.conf
together with a description of the problem to
.B stacia@service-technology.org.
At https://gna.org/bugs/?group=service-tech you can see a list of open bugs.
